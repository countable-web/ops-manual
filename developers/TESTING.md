Testing and Bug Reporting
=========================

**Purpose**

To establish how and why we do testing at Countable.

**Scope**

Currently covers basic testing principles and bug reporting procedures.

Testing Principles
------------------

The goals are to write as few tests as possible for maximum coverage of
real world usage (not code coverage).

-   Write tests to increase confidence that our customers\' experience
    will be good.
-   To exercise important flows like signing up, purchasing, core
    product experience.
-   Prefer e2e tests, the highest possible level, over unit tests (most
    of the time).
-   Tie test cases to unchanging real world business logic and inputs,
    not implementation. This prevents their need to be rewritten during
    refactors.
-   Keep your test scenarios and code as similar as possible to real
    usage. Your tests should run the backend server, load actual client
    pages (like selenium would), and flip a switch to trigger test mode
    in your front end template.

Bug Reporting Checklist
-----------------------

These are the required steps for reportings bugs at Countable. Make one
Trello Card per bug.

*Your job when reporting a bug is to make it clear to the developer how
to see the bug*

1.  Briefly describe the current behaviour and how it differs from the
    desired behaviour.
2.  Include the exact URL where the issue can be observed.
3.  Note what browser/device you are using unless it is Google Chrome
    (this is assumed otherwise).
4.  List any further steps (specific clicks, etc.) to observe the issue.
5.  For aesthetic problems, take a screenshot and circle the problem in
    red.
6.  For text problems, quote the problematic text.
7.  Use a red \"bug\" label in Trello to mark bugs.
8.  Assign the bug to someone who can either fix or triage it.

The developer will spend 2 minutes with your instructions trying to see
your bug. If they can\'t, they\'ll comment in the card with what they
tried, and archive your bug.
