Python
======

**Purpose**

Capture our coding standards for Python projects, alongside other things
that are useful to know when working on Python codebases at Countable.

**Scope**

Aggregation of all Python-specific standards, best practices, and known
problems we may encounter.

Python Code Standards
---------------------

For Python code, please comply with PEP-8. Editor plugins can automate
most of the rules for you. Common mistakes:

-   Use the `black` autoformatter.
-   [Functions should be
    snake\_case](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-names)
-   [Classes should be
    UpperCamelCase](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#class-names)
-   [Constants should be
    ALL\_CAPS](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id48)

### Imports

Order imports as follows

    # Builtins
    import os
    import sys
    import csv

    # 3rd Party
    import django

    # local
    import mymodule

### Exception Handling

Best practices for handling errors/ unexpected cases

    # bad - lost information about the error
    try:
       1/0
    except:
       print("I don't know what happened")

    # preferred - capture specific exception class
    try:
       1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("now I know the exception")

    # when error is unexpected/unknown, do a catch-all and do a traceback
    try:
       1/0
    except Exception:
       import traceback
       print(traceback.format_exec())

    # bad - unnecessary lines in the try block
    try:
       a = 1
       b = a-a
       a/b
    exception ZeroDivisionError:
       print("One of these lines failed")

    # better - isolate which lines you expect to fail 
    a = 1
    b = a-a
    try:
       a/b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Now we know which line failed")

### Line Length

Lines of up to 119 chars are ok, instead of the default 79 chars. The
reason for this is we have higher resolution screens these days and 79
chars is crazy restrictive.

Names
-----

-   attributes\_names - Attributes (and local variables) should use
    lowercase with underscores

Debugging Python
----------------

### Basics

-   You should become familiar with Python\'s debugger, `pdb` . Here are
    a few common cases with recipes.
-   If you want to inspect any object (variable) in python, use the
    `dir(obj)` function in the python CLI (\>\>\>)
-   If you want to know the source file of any module, do
    `import module` and then `module.__file__`

**There is a trace in Library code and you want to look around**

1.  Look at the stack trace, and identify the file and line you want to
    break at.
2.  Add `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` on that line and save the file.
3.  Run your program, and when that line is reached the debugger will
    start interactively in your terminal.

**The program is really unstable and you want to debug whenever it
crashes.**

1.  Replace the executable `python` with `pdb` temporarily, in your
    Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml
2.  For example, `python manage.py runserver` becomes
    `pdb manage.py runserver`
3.  Now, restart your web (django) container in the foreground. ie)
    `docker-compose stop web && docker-compose up web`
4.  When the program crashes, your terminal will halt in a PDB interface
    and you can print variable names, etc.
