**Purpose**

To identify the norms and practices of our UX-driven process at
Countable.

**Scope**

Currently covers marketing, branding, user experience design and
testing.

Marketing
---------

Defines how we communicate with potential clients. It screens for
clients with similar values, with whom we\'d like to collaborate on
exciting projects. To anchor this, revisit our [Value Prop for
Clients](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/sales/SALES.html#value-prop)

Branding Projects
-----------------

### Branding Process

1.  Brand development questionnaire
2.  Discovery meeting (review other work, discuss answers to
    questionnaire). The person delivering the work must attend this
    meeting, in-person or web conference.
3.  Develop creative brief (internal). See the example Creative Brief
    below.
4.  Propose sketches and color paletttes. Cherry pick key points from
    the creative brief to present.

### Branding Guidelines

How can we get more buy-in, commitment, alignment and clarity earlier.

-   Validate the direction by reviewing other work together.
-   Inspiration board.

Demonstrating reasearch, expertise and intention in designs.

-   Provide about 3, no more than 5. \"I\'ve narrowed dozens of sketches
    down to the best 3. This is why I recommend these directions to your
    audience\...\"
-   Explain how the proposed designs capture their desired brand
    requirements, and appeal to the audience.

Creative Brief
--------------

Visual design is a communication tool for meeting the right kinds of
clients and subcontractors. We aim to establish visual standards to best
connect us with people who will go the distance to make a big postive
impact on the world.

### Offering

-   We rapidly prototype custom software using web technology to
    understand domain problems more deeply and demonstrate value early
    on.
-   We do our best to embody transparency and maximize value creation
    for everyone as a side-effect of creating value for stakeholders.

### Audience

#### Clients

-   We are segmenting (filtering for) groups inside organizations who
    identify as startups but often exist in other organization
    structures. People who want to try something new and affect change
    using the web.
-   Typically, small enterprises (50 to 500 employees) often with some
    technical acumen (3 to 5 out of 10), no in-house developer team, or
    an incomplete one that lacks some web tech areas.
-   Another example is a funded startup that needs a world class web
    technology component such as a dashboard, customer interface or API.
    *Persona: Tifa has raised seed funding and needs a prototype for
    market research, further momentum with funders.*
-   Lastly, we\'d like to continue to pursue government contracts
    particuarly when there\'s a clear agenda for change using the web.
    There is a movement in BC government to embrace agile methods and
    improve software that we\'re excited to support and be part of.
-   The typical decider is the owner or tech lead of the organization.
    *Persona: Barrett runs a private firm that developed a disruptive
    hardware component but doesn\'t have web UI, apps or cloud
    integration.*
-   Their web app will touch many people. We\'d rather build things that
    are publicly used by millions, because these tend to have higher
    impact (all other things equal), and create more visibility for us.
-   We want clients who are interested in \"growing the pie\" rather
    than \"dividing the pie\". A warning sign of a bad client might be
    someone who thinks our hourly rate is too high for example. An ideal
    client should be happy that we charge a profitable rate because: We
    want partners who want to make money together with us, not make
    money at our expense; We want partners who choose us because of
    outsized value, not because we\'re cheapest; We want clients who
    push us to create more value for them; If we can\'t provide enough
    value to charge profitable rates, we shouldn\'t be hired by that
    client because both sides should find a more ideal partnership.
-   We should be able to create *at least* \$100,000 in value for the
    client, and should be able to charge a third of that. Our typical
    minimum contract size should be \$30,000, so that they make at least
    \$70,000 in profits.

#### Staff

We want to attract ambitious, talented people who are good
communicators. *Persona: Aeris wants a job that is challenging with lots
of autonomy to hone her skills alongside ambitious and skilled peers.*

#### Segmentation

Given our experience range is so broad, it\'s hard to segment by
industry. Instead, we segment by ambition. Our value prop \"Look at this
wide range of great projects we\'ve done: We can do anything on the web.
If you have a moonshot idea, want to go beyond the status quo in our
business where no one else has before, you don\'t want someone who
specializes in your industry\'s status quo as they\'ll deliver just
that. We\'ve demonstrated the ability to create next-level web
technology that disrupts your competitors and breaks your industry\'s
mold. We create leaders on the web.\"

### Competition

Several other categories compete with us, including hiring in-house,
freelancers, placement firms and agencies. Of these, we most directly
compete with agencies who do end-to-end web based software development
work. Here are some we admire, and why.

-   [Dockyard](https://dockyard.com/) - open source focused, profess to
    \"make an effort to both teach and learn\".
-   [Caktus Group](https://www.caktusgroup.com) -They\'ve focused on a
    specific technology (Django) to be best at. [Open
    source](https://www.caktusgroup.com/about/)

\- [TWG](https://twg.io) - Great services page, [very
clear](https://twg.io/services/). Agile, fellow Canadian.

Top google results for \"Web Application Firm\" and \"Web Software
Firm\". This means they have pretty effective SEO/copy.

-   [CoResolutions](https://coresolutions.ca/)
-   [SCNSoft](https://www.scnsoft.com/)
-   [Falcon Software](http://www.falcon-software.com/)

Top company identified on clutch.io, Canada (that we actually like)

-   [Lift Interactive](https://liftinteractive.com/) -Highest billable
    rates in this list.

Similar scope/approach:

-   [Five Agency](http://five.agency/how-we-work/)
    -   Good process explanation.
-   [Breue](https://breue.com/) - Super clear CTA \"Get your free
    product roadmap today.\"
-   [AndYet](https://andyet.com/) - Likes bleeding edge front end web
    tech, novel approach.

We admire these teams for beating us on contract bids :)

-   [Freshworks](https://freshworks.io/) - Beat us at the Mines Digital
    Services contract.
-   [RealFolk](https://www.realfolk.io/) - Beat us at the Concierge
    (devex) project.

    Management System enhancements contract.
-   [LlamaZoo](https://www.llamazoo.com/) - Beat us at a VR demo
    project.

### How we want to Differentiate

-   Specialize in audacity. Work with clients to develop a stretch goal
    that\'s exciting to collaborate on.
-   Expertise in prototyping quickly to test ideas and market response.
-   Pre-packaged best practices for avoiding technical debt, helping
    with succession, scalability, operations.
-   Focus on our versatility, and successes in many different
    industries.

#### Impression

This is a web dev firm, that has great technical depth\", as soon as the
page loads. This technical depth should be apparently simply from the
form of the site.

#### Theme

Space + dreams. Space is a little overdone, lean towards the latter
going forward. Dreams characterize our values of working for big impact
long term, enabling creators on the web, and making a better remote work
environment for our team.

#### Tone

-   Audacity. Big Dreams.
-   Clarity and simplicity.
-   Adaptability.

### Design Principles

1.  All design elements should be intentional and have an explainable
    purpose. Less elements emphasizes the best ones. Don\'t try to be
    clever or subtle. This symbolizes how we value clarity and
    simplicity.
2.  The design should be functional, and facilitate the intended usage.
3.  The design need not always follow design trends but should at least
    indicate we are aware of them. Cherry pick some trends that work.
4.  Advanced technical elements (3d, parralax, etc ) are good because
    they showcase out technical work but should not be used at the
    expense of being simple.
5.  We value clarity over cleverness and subtlety.

We like the ideas from [Brutalist Web
Design](https://brutalist-web.design/)

### Evaluation of Creative Ideas

To evaluate creative ideas, first spend 6 minutes generating your own
ideas for the problem and write them down. Compared to using evaluation
criteria, the best ideas are identified 77% of the time instead of 51%
of the time this way.
