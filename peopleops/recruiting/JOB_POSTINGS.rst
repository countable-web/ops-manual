Base Job Posting
----------------

Hi!

``cta (call to action) here "let's chat"``

Want to be challenged by a team who will push you to your potential, and
support you along the way? If so, we may be the place for you.

We are technology consultants and product creators who love to prototype
and experiment on the web. Our roster of happy clients includes the
Tesla of boats, a star-trak grade medical devices startup, global
comicbook brand, and a next generation of cellular data provider. We
help socially responsible, driven, and lucky companies across the globe
get their piece of the internet, whatever form that may take. It
involves creating amazing things in an environment of your own design.
We want you to help us envision and shape the company. Every voice
matters and we want to find ways to always improve, push each other to
our potential, and be the best solution for our users. We're also
ridiculously transparent from the ground up: we've open-sourced our
company's operations manual here if you want to learn more about our
current thinking.

   communicate, learn and improve.
-  Want to be part of our mission to empower creators on the web.

   nearby.
-  Be a continuous, self-motivated learner, and take initiative to
   improve the environment for yourself and your team members based on
   monthly objectives.
-  Experiment with great focus, but know when to investigate a problem
   deeper yourself, and when to ask your team for help.
-  Voice disagreements rather than keeping them to yourself. We need all
   opinions need to be on the table in order to make the best decision.
-  *Clouds and Dirt* - Consider both the big picture and minute details,
   from a client's overall business down to crossing T's and dotting
   I's.

   complex environment with many distractions.

`Here is a guide <https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/peopleops/recruiting/HIRING_FIT.html>`__ to determining if you're a good fit. If these things
don't resonate with you, please don't apply. Our screening process will
determine you're not a good fit so applying would be a waste of
everyone's time.

We are open to a variety of work arrangements and time commitments, let
us know what you prefer.

Your application must include a resume, and a cover letter. To avoid
automated submissions, and to see if you pay attention to detail and
follow instructions, your cover letter must have exactly 100 words
explaining your back story, and exactly 100 words about your first
impression of Countable, and a question about us. Further instructions can be found at: https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/peopleops/recruiting/APPLICANT_GUIDE.html . I hope you're
interested in being part of our mission (see documentation link above).
If you help achieve it, there are stock and cash bonuses available.

I look forward to hearing from you!
