This is a guide for people applying to Countable. We'll expand it in the future (with your feedback I hope). For now, we suggest:

  - Have a peek around the rest of this manual to see how we operate.
  - Read about who we think is a good :doc: `HIRING_FIT`
  - Check out countable.ca (and cortico.ca) to see a bit about our work.
  - See our team page. https://countable.ca/careers

Specifically, please share the following:
  - Links to your work online (anything you've created).
  - Share your thoughts on our :doc: `/philosophy/PHILOSOPHY` (You don't have to agree. We prefer thoughtful disagreement over blind agreement)
  - We want to hear your story, and what's different about you.
  - Also, give us a glimpse of the future you'd envision working at Countable. Explain why you're applying here isntead of your other options.
  - We love feedback! Tell us how we can make your experience applying to Countable better!
