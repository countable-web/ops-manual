Communications Charter
======================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Purpose
~~~~~~~

Help everyone at Countable understand how to indicate their availability, reach out to others using various appropriate channels, conduct meetings of appropriate scope, get feedback on our work every day, and give feedback to our teammates.

Scope
~~~~~

Define how we designate our availability to the team, use different communication channels for different purposes, utilize feedback loops to get better at our work, and communicate with teammates.

Availability
------------

-  Each team member determines their own hours and communicates that to
   the team.
-  We assume most people will not work on weekends or stat holidays, but
   you are welcome to. Try to work on your own on holidays so you don't
   pull someone in who was planning the day off.
-  While there are occasional emergencies that may require it, we try to
   minimize the pressure on people to work beyond 8 hours a day.
-  Indicate what hours you will work in the `staff schedule <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zh6GYex7UtoZGyChRGNy8378brtxvfrOdtedf6z5c5M/edit#gid=0>`__.
   This isn't written in stone but allows your team members to plan when
   to work with you. If you change it one day, just let your team know
   in advance.


Guidelines for All Communication
--------------------------------

We want to restrict types of communication by channel so people aren't
stressed by having to listen on all channels at all times. For example,
we expect people to check email just once or twice a day, and not on
evenings or weekends, so don't feel guilty about not checking it on your
time off.

-  Where possible, communication is ``asynchronous`` because we have
   different schedules and often timezones too. This means it will often
   be a few hours or even a day before you get a response to Slack or
   Email messages.
-  For complex or emotionally charged conversations use voice (appear.in
   or phone)
-  Being brief in email/slack amongst ourselves is ok.
-  There are arguably two "modes" that people work in. "Focus mode" and
   "Collaboration mode". Slack is great when you're in collaboration
   mode, but it's ok to turn off all channels and focus on your work
   too.
-  It's always better to speak up if you have a concern, or any
   information that might be important to the group. If you're worried
   about how the group will react, say so. We're all commited to
   speaking up, and listening respectfully. We can't make the right
   decision without everyone sharing all their information. Find a way
   to share your concern, that you are most comfortable with.
-  Talk to your team and clients every single day you work. You should
   indicate what you're working on, and keep track of any special
   deadlines set by your team. For example, when you're blocking someone
   else or a client requests a special deadline.

Calendar Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  The calendar is the single source of truth for meetings. They are
   only held by people invited to actual calendar events.
-  We do reply to calendar invitations (within 24h, because that's the
   maximum frequency for checking email)
-  We make our calendars public (to show when we're busy, not exact
   events).
-  We add our vacations or holidays into the event calendar as
   following: ‚ÄúName‚Äù vacation (# of days )

Email Hygiene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We recommend you disable email notifications on your phone. It's a
   non-urgent channel and we don't want to be distracted by it.
-  Email good for announcements, but should link to something in Trello
   (if it requires followup), Google Docs (if it is a resource we may
   need later), or Slack (if it's a discussion).
-  The email channel is not urgent: 24h response time is ok. We
   recommend checking email only twice daily, only on weekdays during
   business hours. If the email is from a colleague, customer, or
   prospect, you must follow up within 24h of an email being sent if
   they expect a response. If a task is requested, either complete the
   task or reply indicating what steps you've taken, what's still
   needed, and when it will be completed with a link to a Trello card.
-  Respond to emails in a way that minimizes back-and-forth. Use a
   calendly link to book meetings if it's with just one other person.
-  No need to check emails during vacation (unless otherwise agreed
   upon). => see next line
-  **You must have an autoresponder set when on vacation**: including return
   date from vacation / back-up contact and details / back-up person
   gets a briefing.
-  Use the "schedule send" option in gmail if sending after hours or on
   the weekend. it's a dropdown on the send button. This helps train
   team members and clients to take a break outside work hours.

Text
~~~~

-  If you'd like someone's attention because you're blocked and they're
   not responding on Slack, we recommend you text them. Do this only
   when necessary.
-  This means, we should share our phone numbers, but only use them for
   urgent requests.

.. _whereby-video-chat-and-in-person-meetings:

Whereby (Video Chat, and in-person meetings)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guidelines for communicating face-to-face

-  Make eye contact 50% of the time when speaking, and 100% of the time
   when listening.
-  Never speak for more than 1 minute without pausing for the other
   person to speak. If they don't, then you can continue.
-  Get in the habit of repeating things back to people concisely in your
   own words. It proves you actually heard them and gave it some
   thought.
-  Everyone in a group should speak some of the time, with contributions
   as equal as possible.

Phone
~~~~~

-  For truly urgent or critical things, we call each other (cell phone).
   Only do this in the evening or weekend of the recipient's timezone if
   it's an emergency. This should be RARE.

Trello
~~~~~~

-  Trello is for tracking what we need to get done (reminders). We use
   variants of Scrum, details `here <../operations/TRELLO.rst>`__.

Office Hours and Presence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Overall objective: achieving our goals but also balancing work &
   private life in a meaningful way
-  However, also take team spirit, team efficiency and feeling of
   togetherness into account.
-  Make sure your calendar is up-to-date and shared/public so we know
   how to reach someone if urgent

Meetings in General
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `meetings <MEETINGS.rst>`__


Slack Hygiene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following notification setting. You should only be notified when
people direct message or mention you, and only during your work hours.
|Slack Notification Setting|

-  Go straight to the point. Don't send people messages to check if
   someone's online, like "Clark", "hey, you there?", or "Can I ask you
   a question?". This sucks, because the person now has to stare at the
   screen for 2 minutes while you write them a message. Just get to the
   point and don't worry about when, they'll reply when they can. The
   expected response time on slack is up to 4 hours during the
   recipient's work hours, so they should check it twice a day. When
   people are in "focus mode", they shouldn't have slack open as it's a
   distraction.
-  If the message could be useful to more than one person, post it in
   the most relevant public or project channel.
-  No instant reply required. Our communication priority order is: 1)
   Call/Text 2) Slack 3) Email 4) Trello 5) Reddit
-  Try to interact with the team about twice per work day on slack, but
   don't leave it open all day, you need some quiet time to focus on
   work. Catch up on your channels, skim and respond where needed.
-  if you read something on a public slack channel, understand it, and
   find it useful, please give a thumbs up üëç or ‚úîÔ∏è or whatever emoticon
   . It helps the people who post in public channels the most to know
   who's read things and what to post.
-  The perfect example of what to use Slack for is: (1) When you're
   blocked by something, make noise to the team channel. (2) Create
   clarity around objectives and user stories. State your understanding
   in your own words so team mates can confirm we're on the same page.

Feedback Loops on Your Work at Countable
----------------------------------------

One of our core principles at Countable is to shorten feedback loops.
There is overwhelming evidence of the benefits of this. One example is
the biggest predictor of happiness in the YCombinator Startup School
program was that startups who talked to users. They were 12.8% happier.

Feedback Sources
-----------------

This is a list of the different places you can get feedback from,
depending on what's most helpful. You don't need them all for every
project, but you should *use at least one of them each day*, ideally
several times per day.

Clients
~~~~~~~

-  Where possible, talk or email with clients directly *rather than
   getting your manager to relay information*.
-  Provide screenshots and a report discussing your work to your clients
   at least once per week, and as often as once per day in between. If
   you don't have access to the client, send this to your manager
   instead.
-  Ship your work every sprint (usually 2 weeks), and show them a link
   to your changes.

Metrics
~~~~~~~

-  What can you measure that captures the value of your work. Ask your
   team and manager to figure this out.
-  Use your "key results" from our OKR spreadsheet. Your job is to get a
   score of "1" on these, and by estimating your score, you can get
   feedback by yourself.

End-users
~~~~~~~~~

-  These people are often your client's customers. It's whoever actually
   uses the product you're working on.
-  Talk to them. Connect with them any way you can so they can tell you
   about their experience and thoughts. Send them a video, screenshot or
   update on new features they've asked about, and ask them what they
   think.

Testing
~~~~~~~

-  Use the software yourself and pretend to be a user. The goal is to
   get inside your persona's head.
-  Write automated tests.
-  Use this sparingly as it's less reliable as outside feedback.

Your Team
~~~~~~~~~

-  Discuss all the above results with your team, and show them your
   work, asking for how to improve.
-  Send your team screenshots, videos, code reviews and other artefacts
   of what you did.

Your Manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Your manager can give you feedback sometimes, but their more
   important job is to help you get feedback from the real word (see
   above)

Forward Feedback (Status Reporting)
-----------------------------------

You should update your team and clients each day with what you've been
working on via Slack, Email and Trello. For the latter 2, these are some
guidelines to help ensure effective reporting.

-  Make sure the business goal under discussion is clear, mention it
   directly.
-  Indicate what steps you've taken.
-  It's great to provide an example (stage site link, screenshot, video,
   etc) of your work.
-  Ask any questions you have, or anything you're unsure about.
-  Indicate your assumptions about the questions, and how you'll proceed
   by default because this way you make it easy for the person reading
   the update to respond. They can say "That's right", or "Yes,
   except..." or "No, I meant this other thing." or "No, let's have a
   quick chat on the phone, something's been missed.".
-  Use the language of your user (user stories) in the update.

For example, updating a client:

::

   Hi Merlin (client name);

   I worked on helping increasing customer signups (business goal) today, and fixed a number of small usability issues (steps taken). See stage.countable.ca and let me know how it looks (example of work)!

   I assume it's ok in the signup form to ask for a phone number after they've already given an email, so we don't lose the customer, right (question with default assumption)?

   As always, let me know if you have any questions!

Nervous? Just send it to your team first and they'll tell you if it
sounds good for the client.

Example of updating your team:

::

   Hey team,

   Signup flow UX fixes are staged, I hope it will help us improve signup metrics (business goal), any feedback much appreciated! See stage.countable.ca (work example)

   What do you guys think of moving the phone number after the initial signup form? I'm assuming it's better and will go ahead if no one objects.

Meetings
--------

All Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The meeting organiser (chair, or guild leader) is responsible for a)
taking minutes in Google Docs and b) that follow-up actions (acc. to 3W
rule) are noted in the minutes, and shared as Trello cards.

Date and Time of Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Our calendar is the source of truth regarding meeting times,
   attendees and cancellation status. All updates to meeting times go
   directly in the calendar.
-  Meetings start on time and stop on time. If someone is late, start
   without them.
-  Anyone who is late should notify the team in advance of the meeting
   so they can proceed.
-  When meeting with external stakeholders, book 50 minutes meetings
   generally (or 25) so there are 5 mintues for the team to discuss how
   the meeting could have been better.
-  When meeting online, like in whereby, list the specific room link in the meeting invite.

Clarity of Purpose at Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  The purpose and agenda of the meeting must be clear, and listed in
   the meeting event details on the calendar.
-  Recurring meetings should review the previous meeting's
   follow-ups/action items. Open up the last week's minutes (or Trello
   board) and review them.
-  If you are presenting in a meeting, send out the meeting goal, agenda
   and materials (such as slides) in advance so the attendees can get in
   the right headspace. Ask for feedback on your agenda, such as topics
   they group thinks will help with the goal.
-  In general, try to make meetings shorter and more specific. If
   possible, make the goal and agenda visible in the meeting.
-  Do not attend meetings if you don't have a good reason to be there.

Record of Meetings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Meetings should have an "output" recorded. For Scrum, this can simply
   be updated Trello board and KR scores. Other meetings should have a
   stream of minutes in a Google Doc that is continually added-to (most
   recent first). Here's a (template)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iyjpQAuxwlEYiW85tJbufXrC-CAw-0AAdzO9FzHSio/edit?folder=1EJtwoxGXasYlv3UbRuzxKVNfgArFSJMn#].
   Each time you meet, fill out:

::

   Meeting minutes template: (copy this for each meeting)
   Date: (202X-XX-XX)
   Agenda (topics discussed, with headlines): 
   (add bullets here)
   Follow-ups (who does what by when):
   (add bullets here)

-  Minutes are just the "headlines". What's the important point? Action
   items can be noted, but should be should be transcribed into Trello.
-  Send a follow-up email with the minutes too, if it includes any
   external stakeholders.
-  3W rule: Meeting follow-up actions must contain the three Ws: WHO
   does WHAT by WHEN

General Meeting Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Work to create an atmosphere of psychological safety. Detect concerns
   of individuals and shed light on them.
-  The maximum number of people at any meeting should be limited to 7
   (except occasional company-wide meets).
-  Avoid speaking for more than two minutes without pausing and letting
   people respond, so you can listen to your audience and steer your
   material to be more helpful. Meetings should be interactive, not
   monologues.

Scrum Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All active projects should have a Sprint meeting every 1 to 4 weeks.

-  Discuss how the current sprint will accomplish our "OKR" for the
   project.
-  See `Scrum <../peopleops/getting_started/SCRUM.md>`__ for full
   instructions

One-on-one Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One-on-one meetings between each manager and reports should be once per
month. This is our chance to catch up on what matters, and think about
how we can work better together. People mentioning problems even once is
a gift: We can't fix systemic problems if I don't know about them.

As an Employee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. This is your time to talk about whatever is on your mind. If you want
   to talk about what's going on with your life, hobbies, etc, that's
   fine. If you want to talk about work or issues at home or career
   progression, that's fine.
2. Give feedback about what went well last month, and what didn't. How
   can we do better from now on?
3. The discussion is confidential by default, unless there are
   suggestions or requests that come out of the discussion to relay to
   the team.

As a Manager
^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Practice listening. Try to contain the impulse to give advice unless
   they specifically ask for it for at least the first 10 minutes of the
   meeting.
2. Raise anything you felt was a problem. Say how you feel about it, and
   let them lead.
3. If they don't bring it up on their own I'll ask questions about
   emotional state and emotional reactions to situations. E.g., "How did
   you feel about what happened at Countable last month?" (be specific),
   "Are you feeling sufficiently challenged?", "What would you like to
   learn?", "What do you enjoy working on most?"
4. TBD: Review job levels. Employees should check off each job level
   requirement, and self-promote when they reach completion of their
   current level. Give the employee a simple desription of what you
   think would really get them "to the next level". Make this as
   actionable and objective as possible, and frame it as a mentor.

The First One-on-one
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. On first one-on-one, ask "tell me about your life starting in
   kindergarten". Write down moments of change, decisions on direction
   and why they were made. 45 mins discussion.
2. What are the person's dreams? Ask "what would you like to do most
   after Countable, if anything was possible? Provide 3 possible
   visions". Make dreams columns and put rows for skills necessary for
   each vision. Ask questions about everything fits together. What
   skills can be developed in their role?

Themes
^^^^^^

Some ideas to pick from, not needed every month.

1. Give each other (employee first) you'd like the other to "continue"
   doing, and something to "consider" changing.
2. Ask: Who did you work with this month, and how did that go? Why did
   it go that way?
3. Ask: What are you learning, and from whom? What are you teaching, and
   to whom? What would you like to learn?

Performance Reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each year, the one-on-one should include performance review
self-assessment. These questions are answered by the employee in
advance.

1.  Is the purpose of your job clear to you? What is it?
2.  Write a paragraph describing what it would be like if you did
    extremely well at your job?
3.  What objectives did you have this quarter?
4.  What were some good key results, and some bad ones? Why did they go
    that way?
5.  Do you feel you took ownership of understanding and meeting (or
    exceeding) customers' needs yourself? Or expected to be given clear
    tasks.
6.  Did you seek feedback from metrics, team members, customers and
    end-users on your work?
7.  How do you feel about your performance?
8.  How do you feel about your learning and professional development?
9.  What would you like to get better at?
10. What would you like to learn, or do more of?

The manager should answer:

1. What can you do to get to the next level in your current role?
2. What's holding you back?

Guild Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We currently have a UX, DevOps, Operations, and Developers guild meetings,
periodically. The purpose of this meeting is:

-  Standardize, train, and define how we work in key technical
   disciplines to become the best in our fields.
-  Present and review each others' work and provide peer feedback.
-  Hold collaborative design activities such as "Mob" programming to
   create something together in the meeting.

Discuss goals for each guild and roadmap for meeting them:

-  UX - improve the end-user experience of all our work.
-  DevOps - make our work delivery automatic, frequent and reliable.
-  Developers - write better code, minimize technical debt.
-  Operations - conduct business efficiently and maintain excellent client relations.

All-Hands Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The entire team meets once per month to plan work pipeline and roadmap
at a high level, and practice new processes together.

Giving Feedback to Teammates
----------------------------

Our team must provide each other with feedback regularly in order to
improve. Some references on why this is:

-  When a thoughtful dissenting opinion is introduced to a discussion,
   it quadruples the chance of the group finding the best answer (study
   cited in Originals, book)
-  Feedback from peers is the most effective way to grow professionally.
   (Originals)
-  Honest feedback prevents the perils of "group think" that damages
   teams as they grow. (Culture code)
-  `Gratitude makes you happier <https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier>`__

When To Give Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Code reviews <../developers/GIT.rst>`__. The benefits of
   Senior developers reviewing Junior developers' code is obvious I
   hope, but it's just as critical to provide feedback as a Jr
   dev¬†because (1) you can learn much faster by reading others' code,
   and asking questions. (2) your questions will help Sr devs make their
   work more understandable. (3) it motivates Sr devs to have someone
   learning from them and seeing their work in general. (4) you can help
   other Jr devs learn. (5) It forces you to understand our standards
   and apply them better if you have to measure other people's work
   against them (6) Sr devs still make of mistakes
-  Peer reviews of UX and Art assets. Ask our team members to share XD
   links, screenshots your work on slack, and give them feedback in
   comments in XD, or right on Slack.
-  When there's a new release, review the stage site for your product.
-  Post a video of using a new product or UI, for the creator to see in
   that project channel.
-  Just PM (Private Message) someone on slack with your thoughts. Ask
   questions, state exact observations, and say how you feel about them.
   (See below, Guidelines)
-  Use the #thanks channel to show appreciation and gratitude. A ton of
   `evidence <https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier>`__
   suggests this makes you, the recipient, and the whole team happier.

Guidelines Around Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Ask your team for feedback. Make it easy for them by sharing a link,
   getting a code review, making a little demo video of what you did, or
   just asking a specific question "What could I improve in my fireball
   casting technique?".
-  When someone does something you like, let them know! That's how we
   get them to do it more. Positive feedback is *easy* to give, everyone
   feels good!
-  Remember the purpose of feedback. We have a team so we can help each
   other improve.
-  Keep it simple and clear. Mention the most important facts
   (observations) to avoid overwhelming the recipient. Small bits of
   frequent feedback are better than a huge essay.
-  It's not about who's right. The process of talking about performance
   and how do things improves everyone's work and helps us work together
   constructively. So don't stress. If you can give and receive feedback
   respectfully we've already won at this no matter what that leads to.

Negative Feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Giving negative feedback can be hard, as we don't want to offend. The
problem is often that people just say "I don't like when you cast green
fireballs." with no explanation. Instead: "When you cast green fireballs
I'm concerned that it makes too much smoke. I've seen this reddit post
about it."

-  Make it clear the goal is to improve the work, and you're giving
   feedback because our team has high expectations, but you think the
   other person can meet them.
-  Be very respectful, constructive, helpful, humble and never mean or
   demeaning.
-  it's ok to be blunt. If you do have evidence of what the problem is,
   be very specific. It's not about your opinion, it's about the facts,
   you're just pointing out evidence.
-  It's also ok to be subtle. Especially if you're not sure what the
   problem is, try being subtle first. Pause to show you're thinking and
   then ask "Does that really work?" "I never thought of doing it that
   way, do you prefer it to my way?". When you question something out of
   genuine curiousity, the person will stop and do the same, without
   being offended. They may not change the behaviour right away but it
   helps more than you think.
-  It often helps to be clear about the actual problem. "I'm concerned
   that if we cast green fireballs, it causes too much pollution." This
   invites them to dismiss you of course, but it will stick in their
   mind.
-  Sometimes it helps to suggest an alternative but stick to the facts.
   "I use blue fireballs because it seems like it saves the environment,
   have you tried it?"

Receiving Feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  It's hard for others to give you feedback, and it's precious. Don't
   bite. You don't have to agree, you just have to listen.
-  Don't interrupt, dismiss, or show impatience or offence. Show
   appreciation for them putting themselves out there to help you
   improve.
-  Paraphrase in your own words. "It sounds like you're saying blue
   fireballs produce less harmful carbon, but defeat just as many
   goblins."
