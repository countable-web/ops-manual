Team Norms at Countable
=======================

Purpose
~~~~~~~

Establishes the norms and policies which guide our collaboration at Countable.

Scope
~~~~~

Covers our principles of diversity and inclusion, training, performance evaluation, and team events. 

Diversity and Inclusion
-----------------------

Here we outline core principles which allow us to approach our differences in a respectful and positive way, and focus on building a shared culture based on empathy and common goals.

Principles
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Countable does not tolerate non-meritocratic bias. We respect and
   support everyone the same, regardless of race, gender, religion or
   other attributes not related to our work. This also means there is as
   a general rule no special provisions made for these groups except to
   prevent, and to eliminate specific cases of, biases.
2. Don't conflate ignorance and malice. It's the responsibility of
   minority groups coach the team on what's considered respectful, and
   it's the team's responsibility to listen and make an effort to be
   culturally respectful.
3. If any team member is aware of disrespectful conduct, it must be
   reported. A manager will issue a warning the first time, and if it
   recurs, immediate dismissal. The warning must be made public to the
   team so everyone can see what happened, worded in a way that doesn't
   intrude on the victim's privacy (the aggressor's privacy is not an
   issue here).
4. It's the managerâ€™s responsibility to create an environment where the
   victim feels safe and comfortable enough to speak up. Any victim is
   protected by the company against any retribution for speaking up and
   is celebrated for their bravery in doing so. Please do speak up so we
   can solve the problem for everyone.
5. This policy is NOT intended to discourage negative feedback on our
   work. Negative professional feedback, offered with empathy and from
   your professional peers is one of the fastest professional
   development tools.
6. Countable acknowledges that gender bias is sadly still prevalent in
   the technology industry in particular. Our goal is to lead by example
   in creating a safe and supportive environment for women (and everyone
   else of course) to work.

Compensation Strategy
---------------------

Covers our basic principles and approach to compensating our team; not everyone will agree with this approach, so it's important we state
it here so we don't have someone with different expectations join the
team.

Principles
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Our approach is to pay people enough to live in reasonable comfort
   and to generally be competitive with other opportunities but we would
   rather start with lower rates and give generous raises compared to
   other companies. This is very important, because if we pay too high
   initially it will result in many staff joining because of the high
   pay, and not because they are a good fit with our many unusual values
   and methods, in order to preserve our culture.
2. Once an employee has completed some OKRs and demonstrated they can
   push the team towards our mission, they will get a substantial raise.
   At this point, we trust they've been vetted to be a cultural fit. The
   raise will be weighted towards stock so that our greated contributors
   are co-owners of Countable Web Productions Inc.
3. This will absolutely lead to unequal pay - if you're good you'll be
   paid a lot more than someone who's still learning to be productive.
   On the positive side, this allows us to afford to hire students who
   still have some basic knowledge to develop in order to be productive.
   I think this is great because it will attract people who propel us
   forward over time, and avoid accumulating people who coast, by
   encouraging them to either improve or leave. It's much more
   motivating working with the former people.
4. If you're assigned a change in compensation, that will take a effect
   starting in your next pay period, not immediately, nor backdated to
   past hours.

Benefits
~~~~~~~~

1. Payment for benefits and expenses directly reimbursable will be
   included like other expenses, alongside payroll.
2. If necessary, the company will purchase a linux computer for you. The
   specs will be commensurate with what your manager decides you need
   after discussing your job. You may not all get the same specs as
   others at the company.

Extended Medical
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We don't currently have an extended medical group insurance plan (partly
as we don't yet have USA employees who tend to be more reliant on this),
but we'd like to help out a little when our team has dental or other
uninsured medical costs. In the future, we plan to improve our coverage
of medical costs but this is a start.

1. Full time contractors (100h/mo or more) and employees receive 50%
   reimbursement for medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar
   year.
2. Part time contractors (50h/mo or more) receive 30% reimbursement for
   medical expenses, up to $1000 CAD per calendar year.

Guilds and Teams
----------------

Countable is divided into Teams and Guilds. The job of Guilds is to be really good at specific things, and the job of Teams is to get results for customers. This document lists our existing Guilds and Teams.

List of Guilds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  :doc:`../devops/DEVOPS` `DevOps Guild <../devops/DEVOPS.rst>`__ - Their goal is to ensure our software is delivered to customers as quickly, reliably and automatically as possible.
-  `Developer Guild <../developers/DEVELOPERS.rst>`__ - Their goal is to improve our code, solve problems for users, and demonstrate working software to our team every day.
-  `User Experience Guild <../ux/UX.rst>`__ - Their goal is to help everyone, from users to product owners and developers, enjoy and benefit from interacting with our software.
-  `Operations Guild <../operations/OPERATIONS.rst>`__ - Their goal is maintaining clear and open communication with our clients, and maintaining the roadmap to sustainable growth for our firm.

Cross-Functional Teams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have cross-functional teams organized by Objective. For example, we have a ``bawkbox`` team whose top level objective is to make it easy for any website to install any 3rd party widget.

With each of our clients, we form a team with some of our staff. 

Countable does not have functional team divisions by job role.

Other Informal Groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On some occasions other groups may organize for professional development or other purposes. These are not ``teams`` in our company's terminology.


Training at Countable
---------------------

We have official training materials
`here <../developers/TRAINING.rst>`__. Bill for your time
doing any of these.

Books
~~~~~

If you buy a book for work, the company will reimburse you. `Suggested reading in References <../philosophy/PHILOSOPHY.rst>`__ that's influenced our culture and
methods.

Monthly Guild Meetings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each month we hold a meeting for any technical specialty the team is
interested in. Currently there's a developer guild meet, a devops meet, an operations meet,
and a design/ux guild meet.

Performance Evaluation Policy
-----------------------------

The purpose of this policy is to "get and keep the right people on the bus" [1]. 

This page lists "job levels". Each employee should be assigned
a level based on the behaviours listed below from levels 1 to 4.

Process
~~~~~~~

-  Key Result score: What is your average score the last 4 months?
-  What does he score in the self-evaluation. For each item in your job
   level? Each question is either zero, half, or one point. Give
   yourself a percentage grade.
-  What is the biggest opportunity for improvement (getting to the next
   level career wise) and #1 strength that we should exploit.

Provide this information to your manager for feedback, and they will
provide any adjustments and their perspective on your answers. The
manager should indicate what's your biggest opportunity for improvement
and strength as well.

Technical Tracks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  DevOps
-  Developer
-  UX / Design

Choose one of the above technical tracks that most closely matches your
work and intended career direction. It won't be an exact match. You
should also indicate detail on your exact technical track.

Job Levels
~~~~~~~~~~

This section is used in the Process above for self-evaluation.

Level 1
^^^^^^^

An internship or Junior. Evaluation of fit to Countable's culture, work
style and technical needs.

-  Regularly review other team members' work to learn from it (code
   reviews, XD links, shared videos, stage sites). To prove you are
   doing this you must ask questions.
-  Ask for help with (or more generally, be highly engaged with and discuss) your `OKRs <../operations/OKRS.rst>`__
-  **You regularly use this operations manual, ask questions about things that are hard to understand or you disagree with, and suggest improvements for clarity.** JC: use this as a model for how to phrase the rest of these items more clearly/implementable
CP: quantifying these items more in general, e.g. "regularly review" becomes "1 hour code review per week"
-  Try to solve problems yourself (10 to 30 minutes). If no clear solution was found, ask specific questions while providing details obtained from the initial investigation. Clarify and state your assumptions when you ask for help.
-  Make consistent small improvements to the systems around you (fix spelling or clarity of README files, small refactors such as renaming a variable for clarity, make a small design or usability improvement).
-  Show gratitude to your team (for example, mention them in the #thanks channel).
-  Share work every day (screenshots, staging links, XD links, code snippets) with the team in your client- and guild- channels, because seeing great work raises the bar for everyone and is very motivating.
-  Take responsibility for specific tasks you are assigned.
-  Notify your client when work is ready, with a link or screenshot for them to see. **JC: this is a higher level AOR (talking directly to the client) and not achievable at this level - report to your teammates instead?**

Level 2
^^^^^^^

Considered a permanent position. Works directly with clients and other
stakeholders on delivering results, only escalating as needed.

-  Remind the team and clients about what our project goal and company
   goals are.
-  Show troubleshooting ability, to get to the bottom of issues in your
   technical track.
-  You share work as far down the chain to end-users as reasonably
   possible every day, collect feedback, and improve. No hoarding work
   in your local environment without publishing it.
-  Give feedback on work that team members share (in your client- and
   guild- channels).
-  Share links (such as on Slack) to relevant pages in the Ops Manual to
   help guide the team (you should make an effort to do this rather than
   offer one-off answers to questions).
-  Manages client's expectation of deliverables and timelines. Is aware
   of bigger picture of project, and helps the team course correct to
   stay on track.
-  Help team members with their `OKRs <../operations/OKRS.rst>`__.
-  Take responsibility for large tasks (> 1 day) and breaks them down
   into Trello cards (< 1 day each).
-  Is aware of clients' satisfaction with work, and ensure a timely fix
   of issues they report.

Level 3
^^^^^^^

Owns a client relationship, leads in a technical area within a guild, or
takes on another area of responsibility.

-  Help to support and teach other team members things inside your
   technical track, OR takes responsibility for their results and
   timelines for at least one specific client or project with multiple
   team members assigned to it.
-  Makes some contributions to the Ops Manual.
-  Work towards a clear, shared goal with the client. Follow up on
   discussions in a constructive way (with respect to objectives). Once
   it's clear, prototype something to validate assumptions as quickly as
   possible.
-  Be competent in more than 1 technical track, and has basic knowledge
   of all 3.
-  Takes responsibility for clients' business results. Doesn't blame the
   client, or external factors. Find a way to achieve the desired
   outcome by working around challenges you cannot control.
-  Maximize iteration speed to get closer to the goals quickly.
-  Take accountability for our team's role in business objectives and
   project health.
-  Tracks and improves metrics.
-  Takes responsibility for the overall success of one or more existing
   clients or projects.
-  For devs, acts conducive with the `Senior Developers <https://roadmap.sh/guides/levels-of-seniority#senior-developers>`__
   section of roadmap.sh developer levels. It's useful for other
   technical workers to review this as well.

Level 4
^^^^^^^

Owns a guild, major client group or customer base (business line).

-  Sets standards for whole team in technical track OR responsible for a
   business area (contributes to several winning proposals and accounts)
-  Makes sure documentation is clear, and the team is improving in that
   area, making major Ops Manual contributions.
-  Stay on top of industry trends in technical track. Research,
   understand and explain trade-offs of competing solutions. Post about
   opportunities to improve (new tools and trends) in guild channels.
-  Work to integrate their technical area with the other technical
   tracks seamlessly in a ways that help the whole team. Be aware of how
   your work impacts other areas.
-  Set high level conceptual alignment and clarity of goals and strategy
   with clients.
-  Evaluate technical work complexity for proposals/quotes and can
   delegate work appropriately.

Dismissal
^^^^^^^^^

While it sounds like a negative thing, not everyone is a fit for
Countable's culture. We think many people are talented but could have a
bigger impact elsewhere which is better for everyone. Things that could
result in you being dismissed:

-  Fail to communicate with users, team, and customers resulting in
   problems.
-  Fail to exhibit most of the behaviours listed at and below your
   current job level.
-  Fail to take responsibility when you make a mistake, and learn how to
   prevent it next time.
-  Miss meetings or appointments.
-  Lose track of client requests because they're not properly logged in
   Trello, or backlog's not monitored.
-  Produce low quality work that's not thoughtful of our future selves
   and which the team wouldn't be proud of.
-  Avoid hard discussions and be a "yes person" without thinking about
   what you're agreeing to.
-  Go "dark" so clients and team mates are unclear about the project
   status (no response for over 1 business day, when a response is
   clearly expected)

[2] `RoadmapSH <https://roadmap.sh/guides/levels-of-seniority>`__ - this is
helpful specifically for devs.


Team Event Basics
------------------

As a company with remote employees, we intend that half of recreational
events can be attended online.

When in-person events are held in just one city, employees may
self-organize events in their respective cities and be reimbursed by
Countable. The default cap is $25/person, for other amounts please get
approval from your manager.
