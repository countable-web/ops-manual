**Purpose**

We use Trello for project management, as it allows unlimited access to
boards by partners and clients, encouraging collaboration and
transparency.

We use Trello because:

:   -   it allows collaboration with clients on assignments.
    -   is simple enough for people to join ad-hoc without training.

[See video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X9x4SCLhKs).

**Scope**

This page describes the basics of Trello, then goes more into depth on
how we use it at Countable.

Guidelines for Our Team\'s Use of Trello
----------------------------------------

Before progressing to the basics and layout of Trello, we\'ll outline
the key guidelines which help maintain a productive workflow in our
team\'s specific Trello methodology.

> 1.  \"Own\" your cards. **If you\'re assigned to it, you should post
>     updates when there are changes, blockers, or reconfiguration**. If
>     others\' tasks rely on yours, directly \"@\" comment them as
>     needed.
> 2.  **If it\'s in a Sprint, it needs to be assigned to one primary
>     team member for accountability**.

Without anyone assigned, cards get lost. If a card is complex enough
that it needs multiple team members accountable, decompose it into
multiple smaller tasks and assign each.

> 3.  Be pragmatic, not aspirational. **The Sprint column should only
>     contain tasks we expect to finish within that Sprint.**
> 4.  **Communicate with your team, and include screenshots and
>     clarifying details.** Many cards are created during discussions or
>     collaboration, and we want to capture the valuable information
>     from that moment in the card.

Trello Basics
-------------

We use Trello for project management, as it\'s simple to set up access
to the appropriate boards by partners and clients. A Trello board
consists of a set of **Cards** (tasks) arranged in **Columns**.

Trello Cards
------------

A card should contain a clear description of work to be done by one
person required to support a given User Story (See
`/operations/USER_STORIES`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}). This may
correspond to a single User Acceptance Test.

During composition, the author of the Trello card should always assume
that the assigned members are without context of the given task.

Before assignment, the details and scope of the card should already be
finalized to prevent confusion.

A card should typically be between 1 hour and 1 day of work. If it\'s
longer, split it into 2 cards in that column.

### Composing Trello Cards

When writing titles for Trello cards, use an imperative voice (e.g.
\"Disable cancel button on page X after doing Y\").

Details should include important information depending on what kind
(Feature or Bug Fix) of Trello card is being created.

**Feature cards should include:**

-   **Current Behavior** - If a current feature is proposed to be
    improved or changed, a specific and clear description should be
    provided to direct the members where the improvement or change is
    applied. For front-end related requests, include screenshots, URL of
    the page if possible, and XD & Google Drive links (if applicable).
    Tutorial video for front-end cards:
    <https://www.loom.com/share/3c91d0cf0348471abb3eed20fc63b4ab>
-   **Proposed Behavior** - Key points should be well-defined. For
    front-end related improvements or changes, if there are any
    references from other websites, include screenshots or links.
-   **Rationale** - For features that are derived from personal or
    internal ideas, define why the feature is beneficial. For external
    requests, include references of discussion threads (e.g. Groove
    tickets, Slack discussion).

**Bug fix cards should include:**

-   **Label** - Card should be labeled as \"bug\". This may be used for
    filtering bugs in the Trello board.
-   **Current Behavior** - Specify what is broken. For front-end related
    requests, include screenshots.
-   **Expected Behavior** - Accurately define the correct behavior.
-   **Steps to Reproduce** - Specify which environment (may be links to
    our staging or production sites) where the bug was encountered.
    Write steps in a numbered list.
-   **Potential Cause and Solution** - *Optional*. Share information
    that may be related to the cause of the bug (e.g. misconfiguration
    in the project settings, Nginx or Docker).

Trello Board Columns
--------------------

### Ideas

*Optional*. Stuff that\'s not clear enough to be in backlog yet.

### Requests

This is the starting point for anyone to add cards, and where cards the
client has requested live until the Scrum Master can review and ensure
they\'re actionable and clear.

If they\'re actionable, move them to Backlog. If they\'re not, write a
comment to the client asking for more information in order to make it
actionable, and leave it in the deferred column.

If any additional requirements steps such as a mockup are required,
mention that in the card. Attach any additional examples and/or
specifications to the card.

### Feedback

*Optional*. On this column, we may store cards that somehow need client
or manager review before proceeding further. In practical terms, we use
this section whenever we need some client data or feedback to progress
with our current task.

### Backlog

Cards that are **clear** and **actionable**. This is the traditional
Scrum backlog list, **ordered by priority** (highest on top), by the
Product Owner.

There is only one backlog column, because we need to use the current
sprint\'s lessons to plan future sprints. So, we cannot plan future
sprints in advance, we can only set card priority.

### Sprint

Cards actively being worked on in the current week.

### Done

Cards that are ready to be tested by the client (and when that\'s not
possible, by the consultant). A test can take the form of a client
approval, code review, or automated test written.

Moving cards between columns
----------------------------

A diagram shows how cards can move from conception to completion
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VrniT1lRqVu9sJr0ZMK1aQLnFwEuFIQD).
As the diagram illustrates, each column corresponds to a specific within
the adapted `/operations/SCRUM`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} framework.

Progress Awareness
------------------

**It\'s essential to keep our clients informed about our current
progress** on particular tasks, so our professional relationship is
strengthened and trust is built.

For this objective, we suggest that you:

1)  Take screenshots of finished progress (when applicable) and post on
    your trello ticket.
2)  Use checklists for keeping track of what\'s being done.
3)  Use \"Screencastify\" chrome extension for recording short
    screencasts and attaching into your trello ticket

The \"critical\" label
----------------------

If you find something that\'s severly broken in any of our websites,
please create a Trello card with a red label `critical`, and tell the
developer who you\'ve assigned it to. Do this sparingly: only when it\'s
something we\'re likely to quickly lose customers over such as a service
being down completely or a button not working.

For less serious bugs, don\'t use this label, just make a regular card.

Boards
------

We typically have one board per codebase with a client, and one per
internal product or project.

The board background color indicates the following:

-   Green - nonprofit or government client (private)
-   Orange - corporate client (private)
-   Red - internal operations (private)
-   Purple - open source project, or other public board (public)
-   Blue - internal product (private)

Forwarding Client Emails to Trello
----------------------------------

Clients will often email you rather than use Trello. This can be fixed
by forwarding their email to the Trello board.

Go to their Trello board, and click settings -\> email-to-board
settings, and add that email address as a contact in your email. You can
then forward emails directly to your trello board.

However, it does make a bit of a mess since email signature images and
other junk show up in the tickets, so it\'s nice to clean them up when
you look at them in Trello.
