Header Formatting Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whatever formatting marks you use to first underline a header in RST in Sphinx, that will be set as "Heading 1" formatting.

Same follows for second and third level headers: they are uniquely determined per-page.

Writing Ops Manual Pages
------------------------

This is a *draft*. Please take these as a rough guide for now, and let me (cvo) know what works and what doesn't. You can add sections not documented here.

An Ops Manual page **MUST**:
  * be written to help employees achieve our mission and create value for our customers.
  * have a "Purpose" heading which concisely summarizes why the document exists, because we want to ensure the area is important to our mission. This SHOULD indicate how we can measure success.

An Ops Manual page **SHOULD**:
  * Have a "Scope" section that identifies what area of work is being discussed, and any definitions to clarify what follows, because we want each process document to be focused on a specific area of work.
  * Contain bulleted lists of process steps, rules and guidelines.
  * Be concise, becasue it's easier for employees to understand.
  * Clearly state the logical purpose, evidence or citation that indicates how the rules help our mission because we want each rule to justify its existence. Use the word 'because' (explain why the step exists) as needed.

Processes
---------
Documenting processes allows your team to improve together at their work. You can talk about how you do things, and how each person can do it better. It also sets you up for automation.
  * Reach out to your team and make sure they know about, and buy into, the process. The best way is to get their help developing the process.
  * Test the documented processes with other people. They should tell you if it's clear, actionable and effective, and how to improve it.
