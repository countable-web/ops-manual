Management
----------

Some resources in line with our thinking on management styles.

### \"The Culture Code\"

Team performance can be predicted by:

1.  All members speak equally
2.  Members maintain eye contact
3.  Members communicate directly with each other
4.  Members break from the team to focus or explore, and bring skills
    back to the team

These are more important for individual performance, so a manager\'s job
is to create \"belonging cues\" which foster the above behaviours. These
things also happen to make it more enjoyable to work together, which is
also important. We need to build trust in each other that Countable is a
safe place to try your hardest, knowing the team will support you
whether you succeed or fail. We need to trust each other enough to give
honest feedback when it\'s hard, so we can help one another improve to
the next level without getting stuck in a rut. We push each other
because we have high expectations for the team, and trust each other to
reach them.
