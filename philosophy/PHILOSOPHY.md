Our Philosophy
==============

**Purpose**

To provide a foundation for all we do at Countable (processes) rooted in
why we do it (philosophy).

**Scope**

Covers our company\'s purpose, vision, values, and principles, as well
as covering our philosophies on transparency and management. We also
provide references at the end that have influenced these philosophies.

Basics of Our Purpose at Countable
----------------------------------

At the most abstract level, we want to solve the problem of information
context. With more data available than ever, the problem becomes getting
the right data at the right time.

To be less abstract, this typically manifests as:

-   Fixing feedback loops. Giving all stakeholders the right information
    at the right time to optimize decision making.
-   Put relevant data at users\' fingertips to enable automation and
    effective, efficient workflows.

Examples of how we embody this purpose:

-   *Better Customer Journey Systems* - Improve customer experiences
    using web technology. With faster feedback loops via prototyping,
    Scrum and tools which improve transparency.
-   *Easier 3rd Party Web Components*: Website Owners should be able to
    install and manage their website from a single place, instead of
    having to find and manage many 3rd party component management
    dashboards.

The purpose statement also says a lot by what\'s left out. It helps us
work towards the same goals as a team, and helps new clients and
colleagues decide if we\'re a good fit. We should refer to this mission
to justify our projects and other pages of this manual.

Lesser purposes of the organization.

-   Provide an exciting, motivating place to work well, and on things we
    believe in.
-   Provide an environment optimized for learning quickly.
-   Continuously improve in how we approach our work.

Vision Statement
----------------

Do you have a problem that might be solvable using the internet?

Our technology is an industry-agnostic method for testing solutions
quickly on the web. Our team developed and operates a cloud-based
solution to user and data management in diverse settings including
marine battery control systems, patient care, fisheries data management,
medical devices, real estate and more. We\'ve solved the core web
technology problems faced by these organizations so they can focus on
delivering solutions to their customers. We prototype your solution in
weeks instead of months, based on an existing infrastructure that makes
it easy to demonstrate benefits immediately.

One of the many deployments we\'ve built and currently maintain in
production is a patient engagement and queue system, which likely
overlaps the scope with the \'patient gateway\' requested by the
Ministry of Health. According to its users, this system has dramatically
improved automated patient access to health care while reducing
per-patient cost by a large fraction.

Another of our products is a web-based widget platform that serves
content to tens of millions of users per day on over a million webpages.

Our mission is to re-invent how web technology is prototyped and
delivered and make it 10x easier for others to deliver their own
missions using the internet.

### Vision Statement (Original Draft 1)

Codify the many-faceted problem of web technology delivery, so it can be
abstracted away and simplified to allow everyone to better focus on
their customers. This should be done in a way that caters to the
situation of a business implementing the technology.

#### Back story

From Clark Van Oyen, Founder at Countable Web Productions.

#### Web Technology Is Still A Dark Art

Over the last decade my journey has involved systems for building out
web technology for businesses. This is largely still a dark art with
unique challenges. The best developers with this capability are
increasingly rare and the competition for their time is fierce. Even if
you do land the right person, they\'re likely to still miss some key
aspect such as:

-   Understanding business priorities and effectively encoding them in
    the nuances of the code and the software development process.
-   Properly mentoring others to fill their role later
-   Using techniques, platform, tools and architecture that others can
    understand and later take over.
-   Having a basic knowledge of security, privacy, copyright law of
    libraries, and other subtleties.
-   How to approach Testing, Deployment and Operational pipelines.

Finding Good Developers, keeping them around, assembling great teams,
transitioning their knowledge, and aligning their work with finding
product-market fit is very difficult and attempting it is expensive.

#### The Vision

What if we could codify web development over time to continuously spend
more time on the \"good\" stuff, focusing on your customers and
opportunities? What if you could have just a little access to all the
right deep domain knowledge in the context of your business? And, what
if we could do all the basic things right by default without needing a
team of amazing specialists.

This is the core idea behind Countable Consulting. To develop the
processes and tools to abstract away the multifaceted problem of
building a web technology team with conventions to get the little things
right by default.

Values
------

alues are ideals that our team members share. This helps us improve
communication among one team. Knowing these values are held, many things
go without saying (and that\'s efficient). Values also help us find
customers and new employees who will get along with us.

-   Challenging but supporting each other.
-   Act based on real feedback and data from customers and peers.
-   Continuous improvement.
-   Building trust based on shared goals.

### Values Survey

We surveyed our team on what values they hold most highly, and the
results are:

    communication (18 points)
    usability (16 points)
    feedback (16 points)
    Several other items were tied at 15 points: learning, organization, clarity of vision, empathy.

We also tried keyvalues.com and this was our consensus selections
together.

### Good Questions To Ask

What matters most to our product (Cortico) customers?

What matters most to our corporate clients?

-   Strategic business goals
-   Increasing ROI, saving costs.
-   How can we create feedback loops with clients?

What matters most to our public sector clients?

What do we really want as a team?

-   Flexible hours and location, good feedback, good mentorship and
    guidance, clear objectives, interesting projects.
-   Working to make remote work better.

Principles
----------

The purpose of this page is to address a specific issue with our
[OKR](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/operations/OKRS.html)
process, wherein by focusing exclusively on some OKR we neglect some
important assumption we should have had all along. ie, by releasing fast
we neglect privacy.

We list principles below in order of descending priority.

We may measure some of these principles, making them into \"committed
OKRs\".

-   *Results are sacred* - Processes, Roles, and other inputs are
    flexible and can be changed when necessary to achieve results.
-   *Ownership* - Take ownership, or be aware of who has taken ownership
    for any outcome we attempt. Tell each other \"i\'ve got this.\"
-   *Privacy through simplicity* - We MUST always be confident that
    anyone\'s private data is secure. When it comes to security private
    data, you SHOULD use the simplest solution as it\'s the most likely
    to be implemented correctly. The best is to never store private
    data. Then, if you must store it, minimize the number of people who
    can access it, and the ways the can access it.
-   *No complacency* - If something is unclear or suboptimal, we make
    some noise about it. Also, we should ensure there is a strong
    feedback loop between peers in a team, and between us, our clients
    and their customers. The output of what you do SHOULD be highly
    visible to those it impacts, and to you. Give, receive, and act on
    feedback as frequently and immediately as you can.
-   *Audacity* - We SHOULD do work that excites us and has a chance to
    change its industry.
-   *Transparency* - We SHOULD do everything in the most public place
    that doesn\'t endanger someone\'s privacy or property.
-   *Continuous Improvement* - Always work to make things a little
    better than you found them. Many small improvements add up.
-   *Prototyping* We publish simple but working models of products to
    real users, as a part of planning them, within weeks not months.
-   *Impact* - We strive to help as many people as possible as a
    side-effect of our work.
-   *Consistency* - We avoid arbitrary inconsistency. Create tools to
    automate and enforce consistency.
-   *Modelling* - We reduce complex phenonemna to simple predictive
    models. Help everyone on your project visualize the desired outcome.
-   *Diversity* - We MUST encourage diversity of thought, treat everyone
    with respect, and work to avoid non-meritocratic bias.
-   *Usability* - We create software with an enjoyable, engaging user
    experience. Don\'t make the user think, wait, or do a task
    unnecessarily.
-   *Asynchrony* - We prevent people needing to ask us for things, by
    putting all information and assets in a place our team can predict.

Transparency Policy
-------------------

There are data indicating transparency is important: \"90% of job
seekers say that it\'s important to work for a company that embraces
transparency.\" (Glassdoor U.S. Site Survey, January 2016; \*Updated
from 96%, Glassdoor survey, October 2014).

Our transparency policy is, any information that we don\'t have specific
and serious concerns about being released is to be made public.

### Further Reasons for Transparency

1.  To avoid secrets. Unnecessary secrets have a cost to the
    organization because everyone must focus on managing information
    access rather than other business activities (which create net value
    unlike hiding information).
2.  Trust. Between any parties working with or within the Company.
3.  Alignment and Clarity. We will be incentivized to design processes
    which benefit everyone. And failing this, at least expectations will
    be laid out.
4.  Learning. To help us learn from others, and others to learn from us.
5.  Experimentation. An experiment on practical corporate transparency
    limits.

### Caveats

1.  As mentioned elsewhere, the need to be clear about what information
    is Confidential and careful it\'s not released along with everything
    else.
2.  The cost of publishing everything on public channels. This should be
    mitigated by automating by convention and tools.
3.  The cost of ensuring what\'s released is clear and interpreted how
    intended.

### Examples of Things We Release Publicly

-   Our operations manual
-   Financial and legal templates
-   (soon) Our corporate subreddit which acts as an advisory board
-   All our brand materials / assets for our company
-   Most (hopefully one day all) of our own source code

### Exceptions (Sensitive Data)

We\'ll note specific exceptions here, where data is considered sensitive
and the minimum necessary people should have access.

-   Passwords to shared accounts
-   Clients\' information (code, correspondence, documentation), or
    information about clients which they don\'t already have public.
-   information on, or belonging to, any users of systems we develop.
-   Employees\' details other than their name, job description, photo,
    and things they\'ve chosen to release.
