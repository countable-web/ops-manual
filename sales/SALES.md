**Purpose**

This chapter documents our approach to taking on new work so we curate a
group of clients we love working with over time, and stay profitable.

**Scope**

This root page serves to anchor the resources that are linked out to
different documents in greater detail.

Sales Basics
------------

### Customer Persona

For our B2B consulting business, we generally work best with:

-   Small to medium enterprise, or medium businesses, from 20 to 200
    employees.
-   10M to 100M revenue.
-   progressive, flexible and data oriented entrepreneurs.
-   A decent level of digital savvy is helpful to understand
    opportunties.
-   They may want to hire us for a skunkworks, or strategic project
    insulated from their organization\'s process.
-   They want help taking advantage of the latest web technology.
-   They\'re more interested in a longer term trusting partnership than
    a one-off project quote/contract.

### Process Goals

-   If we can get 2x as fast at writing proposals (and we find enough
    good ones in salesbot), we can probably write (and therefore win)
    twice as many. This is probably easier than increasing our win rate
    (in revenue wins).
-   If we increase the size of proposals we apply to, to be in the
    optimal range of 100k to 500k, that will also increase our
    performance. I know we talk about ideal size and even score it, but
    there\'s definitely some strategic imperative to focus on this size
    range. If we double our deal size, all other things equal we double
    our win rate.
-   Our win-rate is already really high, but any small improvement there
    means we can spend more time working and less time writing, and also
    increase our revenue proportionally.

In summary, we want to steer everything (salesbot included) to find **4
or 5 \$300k proposals every month**, and get faster at writing them via
templates, practice, etc.

A dedicated staff member would be hired for the heavy-lifting, and we
could win 1 deal a month, which is more sustainable than one every \~3
months as we do now.

### Day to Day Practices

-   Talk to your clients every week at a minimum. If you\'ve worked on
    something, ensure you show what you worked on, ask for feedback.
-   When communicating with clients, a functional link so they can test
    it is best. A short video demo is great, or just an email with
    screnshots is ok too.
-   Folks who are receiving Salesbot digest emails should catch up on
    reviewing their RFP \"inbox\" at least once a week. Share any
    promising leads in the \#sales channel in Slack.

### Roadmap

-   Improve at asking for referrals.
-   Develop some outbound process such as surveying prospective
    companies we\'d like to work with on what solutions they want.

### Research

Some stats to keep in mind: There\'s a 2% close rate on the first
\"touch\" or contact with a customer. This raises to 80% after the 12th
touch.

Value Prop
----------

> *Loyal Contracting, Designed for You*

Our goal, simply put, is to offer our clients a \"best off all worlds\"
solution to the trade-offs of staff, freelancers and agencies.

-   The simple hourly flexible capacity of freelancers/contractors.
-   The unified architecture and project management of the best
    agencies.
-   The consistency and retained learning of an in-house team with the
    best mentoring structure.
-   Pre-packaged web delivery pipelines unrivaled by any of the above.
-   Long term shared commitment of collaboration unrivaled by any of the
    above.

Channel Research Process
------------------------

1.  List all the places you could connect with customers and capture
    leads.
2.  Include creative ways such as finding out who \"knows\" your
    customer, and who they pay attention to.
3.  Sorty the channels that have the highest expected value (most
    qualified, numerous, valuable leads).
4.  Test the top 5 channels by investing a few hours and/or a few
    hundred dollars.
5.  Repeat the above step, slowly re-ordering your list based on the
    number of leads you actually get, and increasing the budget.
6.  When you start getting sales, this can replace leads as the
    criterion to order your list.

You now have all the information you need to optimally invest your
advertising budget.

Lead Filtering Basics
---------------------

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those
who believe in the same things as us. The following set of inquiries
outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and
clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1)  Can we articulate one of the following together? A problem,
    opportunity, or vision.
2)  Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a
    big impact?
3)  Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you
    have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let\'s
prototype a relationship - we\'ll complete a 3 week project together
with no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to
pursue further work.
