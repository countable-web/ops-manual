Project Discovery
=================

**Purpose**

Our first job on a project is get everyone involved aligned on the
project goal, and our discovery process is designed specifically to do
that, and then to prototype working technology to start delivering value
as early as possible.

**Scope**

The agenda of for a kick-off meeting, and next steps.

Kick-off Meeting
----------------

Before starting the project, ensure the
`PROJECT_STRUCTURE`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} is set up.

For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or
over video chat. Text based interaction isn\'t good enough for these
critical questions.

**Goals**:

-   Get an initial understanding of the problem, and the project success
    vision. Start the stakeholder map, so we can loop those people in
    and make them feel part of the team.
-   Get clarity and empathy on what the users really need, and set the
    process underway to refine that knowledge (Get buy-in on user
    research).

Clearly define the problem:

-   What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a
    list of the personas, and high level stories (also called value
    hypothesis or value proposition or \"Epics\").
-   How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
-   What is the SINGLE most important benefit you expect this project to
    provide to the user?

Describe the impact of solving the problem:

-   What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much
    detail as possible about that vision.
-   How will success overall be measured (what numbers would move)?
-   What is the ideal overall measurable impact of the project to the
    organization? What about on those it serves?

Identify stakeholders:

-   Identify roles on project team: scrum master (Countable), product
    owner (usually client, assisted by UX researcher), developers.
-   Who will we get to work with and in what capacity? (make a list)
    Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
-   Who else is involved with, affected by, or has input into this
    project, and how?

Next Steps (discuss and assign who does each, by when):

-   What assets and access is required for the project and who will
    provide it, by when?
-   Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and
    team.
-   What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
-   Discuss deliverables necessary at each project phase, and deadlines.
-   Summarize project planning materials to be created.

Project planning materials:

-   Include a User Experience design / user resarch plan.
-   Draft of User Epics (high level stories)
-   Critical path document.
-   Stakeholder map.
-   Architectural design and resourcing (system data flow diagram,
    schema, stack components)

### User Experience Design (UX) Planning

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above
answers to develop a [user experience design](../ux/UX_DESIGN.html)
research plan.

### For Branding and Visual Design Projects

-   Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are
    close to what they want.
-   Use the branding questionnaire.
-   If it\'s in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual
    primitives if new ones needed.
-   Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
