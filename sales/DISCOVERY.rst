Project Discovery
=================

**Purpose**

Our first job on a project is get everyone involved aligned on the project goal, and our discovery process is designed specifically to do that. This, and all our other processes are what we've found helps us deliver working technology to start delivering value as early as possible.

**Scope**

Here we provide a checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

Onboarding New Clients
----------------------

Steps for onboarding a client:

-  A contract must be signed with the client.
-  In the contract appendix A, our services should be summarized, along
   with any key opportunities or problems we can help with.
-  Create a project in Trello, a Slack Channel, shared Google Drive folder, and any necessary code
   repositories.


Lead Time
~~~~~~~~~

-  The team's capacity must be checked, and then a start date and project
   delivery timeline can be determined.

Minimum Billable Amount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Any additional request (ie, via email) for technical work (anything
   not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for
   example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received
   in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This
   encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low
   enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of
   small requests since it's much less efficient that way.

Budget Changes During the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  During the project, if we expect to exceed the budget, tell the
   client and your manager ASAP, and explain what happened.
-  If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you
   didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we
   also often finish early which balances out. If it happens a lot and
   can't be solved by communication, the client is a bad fit for us, and
   we shouldn't be working with them. Inability to communicate on
   budgets is a useful way to identify a bad client relationship.

Kick-off Meeting
----------------

For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or
over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these
critical questions.

**Goals**: 

-  Get an initial understanding of the problem, and the project success vision.
   Start the stakeholder map, so we can loop those people in and make them feel part of the team.
-  Get clarity and empathy on what the users really need, and set the process
   underway to refine that knowledge (Get buy-in on user research).

Understand the problem:
-  What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list of the
   personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis or value proposition or "Epics").
-  How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
-  What is the SINGLE most important benefit you expect this project to
   provide to the user?

Envision what it would be like if magically solved:
-  What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much detail as
   possible about that vision.
-  How will success overall be measured (what numbers would move)?
-  What is the ideal overall measurable impact of the project to the organization?
   What about on those it serves?

Identify stakeholders:
-  Identify roles on project team: scrum master (Countable), product owner (usually client, assisted by UX researcher), developers.
-  Who will we get to work with and in what capacity? (make a list)
   Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
-  Who else is involved with, affected by, or has input into this project, and how?

Next Steps:
-  What assets and access is required for the project and who will provide it,
   by when?
-  Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and team.
   What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
-  What project planning materials will be used, by whom, and by when, in order to accelerate the project?
   Include a UXD / user resarch plan, draft of User Epics, and critical path document
   (phased deliverables, including prototype phase), stakeholder map.

Sprint Meeting Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If there's over 40 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting
   every week.
-  If there's at least 20 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting every 2 weeks.
-  If there's at least 10 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting once per month.

User Experience Design (UX) Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above
answers to develop a `user experience design <../ux/UX_DESIGN.html>`__ research plan.

For Branding and Visual Design Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are
   close to what they want.
-  Use the branding questionnaire.
-  If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual
   primitives if new ones needed.
-  Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
