Project Discovery
=================

**Purpose**

Our first job on a project is get everyone involved aligned on the project goal, and our discovery process is designed specifically to do that, and then to prototype working technology to start delivering value as early as possible.

**Scope**

The agenda of for a kick-off meeting, and next steps.


Kick-off Meeting
----------------

Before starting the project, ensure the :doc:`PROJECT_STRUCTURE` is set up.

For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or
over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these
critical questions.

**Goals**: 

-  Get an initial understanding of the problem, and the project success vision.
   Start the stakeholder map, so we can loop those people in and make them feel part of the team.
-  Get clarity and empathy on what the users really need, and set the process
   underway to refine that knowledge (Get buy-in on user research).

Understand the problem:
-  What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list of the
   personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis or value proposition or "Epics").
-  How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
-  What is the SINGLE most important benefit you expect this project to
   provide to the user?

Envision what it would be like if magically solved:
-  What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much detail as
   possible about that vision.
-  How will success overall be measured (what numbers would move)?
-  What is the ideal overall measurable impact of the project to the organization?
   What about on those it serves?

Identify stakeholders:
-  Identify roles on project team: scrum master (Countable), product owner (usually client, assisted by UX researcher), developers.
-  Who will we get to work with and in what capacity? (make a list)
   Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
-  Who else is involved with, affected by, or has input into this project, and how?

Next Steps:
-  What assets and access is required for the project and who will provide it,
   by when?
-  Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and team.
   What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
-  What project planning materials will be used, by whom, and by when, in order to accelerate the project?
   Include a UXD / user resarch plan, draft of User Epics, and critical path document
   (phased deliverables, including prototype phase), stakeholder map.

Sprint Meeting Schedule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  If there's over 40 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting
   every week.
-  If there's at least 20 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting every 2 weeks.
-  If there's at least 10 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting once per month.

User Experience Design (UX) Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above
answers to develop a `user experience design <../ux/UX_DESIGN.html>`__ research plan.

For Branding and Visual Design Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are
   close to what they want.
-  Use the branding questionnaire.
-  If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual
   primitives if new ones needed.
-  Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.
