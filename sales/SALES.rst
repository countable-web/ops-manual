**Purpose**

This chapter documents our approach to taking on new work so we curate a
group of clients we love working with over time, and stay profitable.

**Scope**

This root page serves to anchor the resources that are linked out to different documents in greater detail.

Sales Basics
------------

Customer Persona
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our B2B consulting business, we generally work best with:

-  Small to medium enterprise, or medium businesses, from 20 to 200
   employees.
-  10M to 100M revenue.
-  progressive, flexible and data oriented entrepreneurs.
-  A decent level of digital savvy is helpful to understand
   opportunties.
-  They may want to hire us for a skunkworks, or strategic project
   insulated from their organization's process.
-  They want help taking advantage of the latest web technology.
-  They're more interested in a longer term trusting partnership than a
   one-off project quote/contract.

Process
~~~~~~~

TODO: sourcing leads. 
TODO: qualifying leads. 
TODO: learn about their
challenges and determine if we can help. 
See `Discovery <https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/sales/DISCOVERY.html>`__

Day to Day Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Talk to your clients every week at a minimum. If you've worked on
   something, ensure you show what you worked on, ask for feedback.
-  When communicating with clients, a functional link so they can test
   it is best. A short video demo is great, or just an email with
   screnshots is ok too.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

-  Improve at asking for referrals.
-  Develop some outbound process such as surveying prospective companies
   we'd like to work with on what solutions they want.

Research
~~~~~~~~

Some stats to keep in mind: There's a 2% close rate on the first "touch"
or contact with a customer. This raises to 80% after the 12th touch.

Value Prop
----------
   
   *Loyal Contracting, Designed for You*

Our goal, simply put, is to offer our clients a "best off all worlds"
solution to the trade-offs of staff, freelancers and agencies.

-  The simple hourly flexible capacity of freelancers/contractors.
-  The unified architecture and project management of the best agencies.
-  The consistency and retained learning of an in-house team with the
   best mentoring structure.
-  Pre-packaged web delivery pipelines unrivaled by any of the above.
-  Long term shared commitment of collaboration unrivaled by any of the
   above.

Channel Research Process
------------------------

1. List all the places you could connect with customers and capture
   leads.
2. Include creative ways such as finding out who "knows" your customer,
   and who they pay attention to.
3. Sorty the channels that have the highest expected value (most
   qualified, numerous, valuable leads).
4. Test the top 5 channels by investing a few hours and/or a few hundred
   dollars.
5. Repeat the above step, slowly re-ordering your list based on the
   number of leads you actually get, and increasing the budget.
6. When you start getting sales, this can replace leads as the criterion
   to order your list.

You now have all the information you need to optimally invest your
advertising budget.

Lead Filtering Basics
---------------------

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those
who believe in the same things as us. The following set of inquiries
outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and
clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articulate one of the following together? A problem,
   opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a
   big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you
   have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's
prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with
no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue
further work.
