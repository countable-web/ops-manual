**Purpose**

The chapter documents our approach to taking on new work so we curate a
group of clients we love working with over time, and stay profitable.

**Scope**

This root page serves to anchor the resources that are linked out to different documents in greater detail.

Sales Basics
------------

Customer Persona
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our B2B consulting business, we generally work best with:

-  Small to medium enterprise, or medium businesses, from 20 to 200
   employees.
-  10M to 100M revenue.
-  progressive, flexible and data oriented entrepreneurs.
-  A decent level of digital savvy is helpful to understand
   opportunties.
-  They may want to hire us for a skunkworks, or strategic project
   insulated from their organization's process.
-  They want help taking advantage of the latest web technology.
-  They're more interested in a longer term trusting partnership than a
   one-off project quote/contract.

Process
~~~~~~~

TODO: sourcing leads. 
TODO: qualifying leads. 
TODO: learn about their
challenges and determine if we can help. 
See `Discovery <DISCOVERY>`__

Day to Day Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Talk to your clients every week at a minimum. If you've worked on
   something, ensure you show what you worked on, ask for feedback.
-  When communicating with clients, a functional link so they can test
   it is best. A short video demo is great, or just an email with
   screnshots is ok too.

Roadmap
~~~~~~~

-  Improve at asking for referrals.
-  Develop some outbound process such as surveying prospective companies
   we'd like to work with on what solutions they want.

Research
~~~~~~~~

Some stats to keep in mind: There's a 2% close rate on the first "touch"
or contact with a customer. This raises to 80% after the 12th touch.

Value Prop
----------
   
   *Loyal Contracting, Designed for You*

Our goal, simply put, is to offer our clients a "best off all worlds"
solution to the trade-offs of staff, freelancers and agencies.

-  The simple hourly flexible capacity of freelancers/contractors.
-  The unified architecture and project management of the best agencies.
-  The consistency and retained learning of an in-house team with the
   best mentoring structure.
-  Pre-packaged web delivery pipelines unrivaled by any of the above.
-  Long term shared commitment of collaboration unrivaled by any of the
   above.

Channel Research Process
------------------------

1. List all the places you could connect with customers and capture
   leads.
2. Include creative ways such as finding out who "knows" your customer,
   and who they pay attention to.
3. Sorty the channels that have the highest expected value (most
   qualified, numerous, valuable leads).
4. Test the top 5 channels by investing a few hours and/or a few hundred
   dollars.
5. Repeat the above step, slowly re-ordering your list based on the
   number of leads you actually get, and increasing the budget.
6. When you start getting sales, this can replace leads as the criterion
   to order your list.

You now have all the information you need to optimally invest your
advertising budget.

Filter
------

Lead Filtering Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both recruiting and sales processes act as a great filter to find those
who believe in the same things as us. The following set of inquiries
outlines the filtering steps necessary. Our prospective hires and
clients should answer yes to these core questions:

1) Can we articuate one of the following together? A problem,
   opportunity, or vision.

2) Do you believe in ruthless experimentation with the goal of making a
   big impact?

3) Will you help to propel our shared team towards this vision? Do you
   have the capability (resources, skills, motivation) to do so?

If the answer to all the above, we might do great work together. Let's
prototype a relationship - we'll complete a 3 week project together with
no commitments. After this, both parties can decide if we want to pursue
further work.

Filtering Proposals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record the RFP due date, organization and link in a spreadsheet, along
with its score as follows:

-  20 points if the RFP is in your niche of products and services.
   Partial points if the industry matches, but not the exact
   service/product (it's nearby).
-  10 points for tech match. Mention of any from: Django, Node,
   Postgres, Vue, React, javascript, web mapping, etc. Deduct points for
   .NET, SAP.
-  10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio
   value.
-  10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
-  10 points if Scrum or Agile is mentioned, partial (5) points if it
   the project is phased with a prototype.
-  20 points for contract size. 0 for $10k, 5 for $20k, 10 for $50k, 15
   for $100k, 20 for $200k and up, 15 for over $500k, 10 for over $1M.
-  10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the
   scoring.
-  BONUS points if it's an existing relationship, we can keep the IP for
   future use, or open source it, or some other circumstance.

50 points is the cut-off for moving on to PRE-QUALIFY

Proposals
---------

The following are actionable tactics to improve the ROI of time spent writing proposals.. The author is most
experienced writing proposals for the public sector.

Principles
~~~~~~~~~~

-  The process starts before you start writing. You want to make sure
   the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing
   anything.
-  Specialize! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old
   proposals that worked. It's better to solve the same problem really
   well than to spread yourself thin. Choose an RFP in an area where you
   have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to
   hilight), and have a network of people in that area. Countable's
   niches are `web maps <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=143&v=PwVRi37qXn8&feature=emb_logo>`__,
   `healthcare <cortico.ca>`__ and optimizing citizen flows for
   government.
-  Use your network's experience, and team up. If you know someone who
   would be really great to add to your team, write them into the
   proposal too, and give them a small cut just for being present, even
   if they do very little work.
-  Score before you Send. Get someone who understands the client to
   evaluate your proposal and give you a score based on the official
   criteria before you submit.
-  Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project, before writing.
   Your questions should increase trust, fill in blanks, and unearth
   hidden needs behind the RFP. Find out the truth about whether you can
   knock it out of the park. Examples "Would you consider a team outside
   your industry who can bring fresh ideas, or prefer a firm with lots
   of industry experience?"
-  Keep the proposal as short as possible while addressing the criteria
   and building trust.

Process
~~~~~~~

In brackets, we indicate the approximate time to allocate (not actual
effort, just time to leave open)

1. CAPTURE - find RFPs you can win
2. PRE-QUALIFY - look a bit deeper
3. QUALIFY - (5 days) ask questions, wait for responses
4. WRITE - (2 to 10 days)
5. REVIEW - (5 days) use an external/impartial reviewer to simulate
   grading the proposal
6. SUBMIT - (1 day)
7. LEARN - update this document

.. _1-rfp-lead-capture:

1. RFP Lead Capture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See `Filter <FILTER>`__

.. _2-pre-qualify:

2. Pre-qualify
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Review all evaluation criteria. What is the estimated score we could
   get on the project? Is it within 5% of frontrunner's estimated score?
   If not, move on.
2. Look deeper at the proposal to see if it's in your niche and you have
   a uniquely great offering that will both let you execute well and
   develop your niche stratgically. If not, move on.
3. Estimate bid size, based on beating the frontrunner's score by 5%. If
   there's no budget for the project, estimate one based on past similar
   projects by the frontrunner, prospect, and software category. Is this
   amount profitable? If not, move on.
4. Is the total timeline under 10 days? If so, the proposal is probably
   "wired" to be given to a specific company. Skip it.
5. Determine who is the "frontrunner", most likely to bid and win the
   project. Is there a strong off-the-shelf solution which is
   compatible, with a local supplier? What is the industry "state of the
   art" in this area. What is being used by others? What companies have
   won similar projects in the past. What vendors have the client used
   for similar projects before? Who has beat you on similar RFPs before?
   Public sector projects will often list applicants directly, or you
   will be able to identify them in the Q&A addendum shared with the
   group a few days in.

.. _3-qualify:

3. Qualify
^^^^^^^^^^

You'll want to ask a few questions before writing. If possible, get on
the phone with someone in order to make a "conceptual agreement". The
goals are to get the interest and then the guidance of the buyer, and
understand their priorities. Demonstrate a genuine interest in the
outcome of the project, build trust, and fill in gaps regarding how well
the proposals fits.

1. If any of the critical info in our capture questions is unknown, ask
   it now (approx budget, technology options, can we use Scrum,
2. Ask: What is the most important benefit to this project for a
   successful outcome?
3. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of your unique approach.
   Ask the prospect if it's a good approach.
4. Ask questions to clarify any scoring criteria so you're 100% clear
   what they each mean.
5. Ask questions to help you understand what the evaluators are looking
   for.
6. If the project solves a real problem, there should be an existing
   (partial, bad) solution. Ask "How are you currently getting by
   without this solution? What process will we be replacing?".
7. Get clarity on anything that might disqualify you, if you're unsure
   about any of the mandatory criteria.
8. If any key consideration is left out of the proposal, ask if it's
   important the product be: Secure, Flexible, Scalable, Low maintenance
   or total ownership cost, Durable data.

Also, create several touchpoints (LinkedIn, email, phone) to get to know
them before you write. If there's a way to demonstrate your system
woring, that is ideal.

Attend any pre-proposal call, webinar or meeting in order to meet the
evaluators.

Do any further research to have information you need to decide to write.

.. _4-deciding-to-write:

4. Deciding to Write
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With all the above done, you should now determine whether to write, or
move on to a new RFP. You should know your approximate chances of
winning, the value of the contract, and your alternatives, and make the
best choice.

Are you the frontrunner? If not, can you propose a solution that is
better in some way that matters to the prospect? The answer to one of
these questions should be YES if you want to write. You must believe you
have a good chance of winning based on all the information so far.

Commission
----------

Commission Basics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Countable pays up to 15% commission to those who help schedule new work
for us (internal or external, referrals or proposals).

Commission is paid out upon receipt of payment from the associated
project.

Proposal Writing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commission is divided as follows.

-  We pay 3% to whoever creates the outline checking grammar + spelling,
   copies content from related past proposals, coordinating deadline,
   and submitting. (admin)
-  We pay 3% to whoever is responsible for sending the qualifying
   questions, identifies the contributor team, and doing internal
   evaluation and review. (manager)
-  We pay 6% to the technical authors who develop the proposal content
   and artwork. (contributor team)
-  We pay 3% to whoever finds the proposal and suggests it to the team
   to write. If it's from a source we always follow, this amount is
   kept. (sourcer)

Estimation
~~~~~~~~~~

Software project cost estimation is `notoriously difficult <https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html>`__.
A typical problem is the team appears to have 70% of the information
when estimating a project, when they really have 30% because by
definition, they can't see black swan conditions (unknown unknowns).

Effort Estimation Process
-------------------------

For all projects:

-  Make sure you summarize the purpose of the work at the top of any
   estimation document.
-  Ask for any details you can to reduce scope uncertainty. Book a (voice) meeting to review this and discuss.
-  Tell the client what you need by when to finish within the budget
   (data, access, creds).
-  Determine their deadline, and build a prototype that captures the
   general idea of the system within 25% of the alloted time.

Quoting
-------

Some companies require a quote in order to issue a purchase order. This
is appropriate when:

-  The amount is at least $5,000.
-  The work is very well understood. We've done something very similar
   before, and understand the steps clearly.

A template is
`here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IJtCsBL-rHwEkd0tcScvZM3IO5Auq3BLQeJSMywc8k/edit?usp=sharing>`__.
To fill it:

-  Fill in 1 to 5 days of effort per line item. Don't separate items
   which are under a day, batch them.
-  Each line item should be for a different team member. To get the day
   rate, multiply that person's standard hourly rate by 8 hours. The
   standard hourly rate (as with other agencies) is around 2.5 times the
   team member's hourly salary, although this varies. You can get the
   hourly rate from our accounting team.

Billing
-------

We have several models depending on what works for a client. Two most
common / preferred:

1. Write a spec and give a quote. Estimate the number of days each work
   item will take. When it's approved, put the tasks from the spec in
   your Scrum Backlog. Whenever something new is added, it pushes down
   off bottom of the backlog (into the Ideas column ideally) and we
   explain to the client those items won't be done since we're doing
   their new request instead.
2. With other clients, we have a backlog and a retainer, so we try to
   work on the backlog a certain # of hours per week and use the Sprint
   meeting to ensure they're happy with progress for what they're
   paying.

Sprint Meeting Schedule
-----------------------

-  If there's over 40 hours per week, we should have a sprint meeting
   every week.
-  If there's at least 20 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting every 2 weeks.
-  If there's at least 10 hours per week, we should have a sprint
   meeting once per month.

Lead Time
---------

-  We normally want 1 week of lead time to deliver items up to 2 days of
   effort. For larger items, we want a week lead time before starting,
   and deadlines will be managed via agile process (no hard deadline for
   specific scope, only identify launch dates and other notable dates
   with desired stories to be filled by then, the team can then focus on
   delivering the user stories as quickly and well as possible).

Minimum Billable Amount
-----------------------

-  Any additional request (ie, via email) for technical work (anything
   not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for
   example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received
   in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This
   encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low
   enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of
   small requests since it's much less efficient that way.

During the Project
------------------

-  During the project, if we expect to exceed the budget, tell the
   client and your manager ASAP, and explain what happened.
-  If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you
   didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we
   also often finish early which balances out. If it happens a lot and
   can't be solved by communication, the client is a bad fit forus, and
   we shouldn't be working with them. Inability to communicate on
   budgets is a useful way to identify a bad client relationship.

Project Discovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our first job on a project is to create a clear shared vision to set the
team up for rapid progress toward product-market fit.

Here we provide a checklist of key steps when starting a new project.

Kick-off Meeting
----------------

For the Kick-off Meeting, meet the product owner (client) in person or
over video chat. Text based interaction isn't good enough for these
critical questions.

Goals: Get an initial understanding of the problem, and the project success vision.
Start the stakeholder map, so we can loop those people in and make them feel part of the team.
Get clarity and empathy on what the users really need, and set the process
underway to refine that knowledge (Get buy-in on user research).

Understand the problem:
-  What problem does this project solve, for whom? This should be a list of the
   personas, and high level stories (also called value hypothesis or value proposition or "Epics").
-  How are the users currently solving or working around the problem?
-  What is the SINGLE most important benefit you expect this project to
   provide to the user?

Envision what it would be like if magically solved:
-  What does success look like for you (qualitatively)? Provide as much detail as
   possible about that vision.
-  How will success overall be measured (what numbers would move)?
-  What is the ideal overall measurable impact of the project to the organization?
   What about on those it serves?

Identify stakeholders:
-  Identify roles on project team: scrum master (Countable), product owner (usually client, assisted by UX researcher), developers.
-  Who will we get to work with and in what capacity? (make a list)
   Book dates/times to meet them. Book any travel plans necessary.
-  Who else is involved with, affected by, or has input into this project, and how?

Next Steps:
-  What assets and access is required for the project and who will provide it,
   by when?
-  Set up a weekly or bi-weekly sprint meeting with product owner and team.
   What other meetings should we attend? Book these.
-  What project planning materials will be used, by whom, and by when, in order to accelerate the project?
   Include a UXD / user resarch plan, draft of User Epics, and critical path document
   (phased deliverables, including prototype phase), stakeholder map.

User Experience Design (UX) Planning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next phase of the project after discovery is to use the above
answers to develop a `user experience design <../ux/USER_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN.md>`__ research plan.

For Branding and Visual Design Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Get the Product Owner to provide 5 examples of other sites that are
   close to what they want.
-  Use the branding questionnaire.
-  If it's in scope, reate brand colors, fonts, logo and visual
   primitives if new ones needed.
-  Visual mock-ups based on the wireframes using the brand styles.

Onboarding New Clients
----------------------

Process
~~~~~~~

Steps for onboarding a client:

-  A contract must be signed with the client.
-  In the contract appendix A, our services should be summarized, along
   with any key opportunities we can help with.
-  The client's top business priorities should be summarized. Document
   any bottlenecks preventing growth.
-  Create a project in Trello, a Slack Channel, and any necessary code
   repositories.

Client Quotes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients may request a budget in an RFP, or a quote for a specific piece of work. Keep the following in mind:

  * Break the work down into about 1 day line items (8 hours), with appropriate level of detail. On larger projects, up to a week can be in a single line item.
  * Our minimum quotable amount is $3,000. Amounts below this should instead be approved via a simple email message or Trello ticket from someone authorized to approve the work.
  * Separate quotes or budgets to be completed at different phases and specify the order (priority).
  * The quote should provide a clear scope of functional specification, and list assumptions it is based on in order to simplify determining whether later changes are in scope or not.
  * Use `this template <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc_xjX-SnOvQ9QemLBrsYtPrBZISqT4H7qFw_Wkn3Co/edit#gid=0>`_.
  * The big caveat with providing a quote, is it affects the work outcome. It may help keep the team focused on what's promised in the quote, but also may prevent fixing problems we find along the way, or looking into opportunities because of the concern of scope creep. This may result in a substantial loss of competitive advantage so we'd encourage our clients to avoid using quotes most of the time. Instead, budget 25% of the original budget for a prototype to multiply your knowledge of the problem at hand, and the decide what to do. At this point the work will likely be much more clear and incremental.

Invoicing Clients
-----------------

Describing client-facing processes around invoicing, and the expectations on both sides.

Process
~~~~~~~

Clients are invoiced before the 10th of each month, and given 30 days to
pay for work completed in the previous month. Depending on the client,
there may be:

1. SaaS fees
2. A retainer amount for advisor services, on-call or maintenance work
3. Portions for completed phases of a flat fee amount
4. An hourly itemized amount (we prefer to avoid these, since it's
   better for clients if we charge for value created, not time spent.
   This helps us collaborate with the client to increase value)

If the amount expected to be invoiced in a single month exceeds the
client's credit amount, they must pay a deposit so their credit is not
exceeded. If a client has paid at least 3 invoices in a row, on time,
they may apply for a credit increase. The credit should not exceed the
total invoiced over the last 3 months. This credit is only usable for
the month work is acted on, and 30 day grace period (see below).

Phased Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For projects in category 3 above (flat fee), phases with dates should be
identified, so it's clear how much is due at each time.

Overdue Invoices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We take overdue invoices seriously, in order to weed out clients who do
not pay on time. By following this policy, over time we will only retain
clients who are able to pay within the agreed term (30 days). While we'd
like to be nice about this, we've found that some clients may abuse that
and will use us as a source of financing, which is not our purpose.

Overdue invoices must be acted on. Here are the escalation steps in
order of severity. Also, new projects and quotes cannot be started or
issued when an amount is in arrears.

1 week overdue: The client receives a warning. We cannot issue more than
one warning per client per year. If a client has already been warned, we
must skip this escalation step. 2 weeks overdue: The client's credit is
reduced, by default to 50% of its' previous value. Record this in the
client sheet. 3 weeks overdue: The client is issued late fees, if
applicable (if they are using our contract). If so, they may stay at
this escalation level as long as late fees are paid within the next 30
days and every 30 days after, and the invoiced amount does not exceed
their credit. 4 weeks overdue: We stop doing any work for the client,
including urgent maintenance work. 5 weeks overdue: The debt is sold to
a collection agency, and the client is black-listed.


Niche Experiments
-----------------

A fundamental challenge in selling the value produced by a company is
market segmentation. Here we define some systematic tests to confirm
exactly who to optimize our products, services and market funnel for.

Criteria
~~~~~~~~

We want to choose the party that enables us to *deliver* the most value.
Finding such an ideal nice is riddled with uncertainty, including black
swans. All the following conditions must be met.

-  Creation of outsized value must be possible.
-  There must be a clear path (project) that can be executed with our
   resources.
-  We must be able to use a prototyping approach to create the value.
-  The project must be motivating to our team.
-  Legal needs must be satisfied. Is there a contract agreeable to all
   market participants?
-  All parties agree to how the value pie is sliced.

The great thing is, our company is built to deal with uncertainty. We do
this via prototyping. The analog in sales is to create "niche
experiments". That is, we set up a low cost sales funnel to test if all
the above conditions can be satisfied.

Process
~~~~~~~

-  Identify the target market segment (persona). What are their problems
   and goals. Talk to at least one of them.
-  What problem can we solve for them, and what is it worth to them?
-  We proceed to unscalably contact one person in this market and
   validate all assumptions with them.
-  Make the sale, and give them a (small) deal to say thanks for their
   help.

If at any point, the next step can't be completed, the experiment isn't
finished and the market should not be invested in.
