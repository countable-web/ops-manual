Accounting For Sales
====================

**Purpose**

To outline all accounting guidelines and processes related to sales.

**Scope**

Currently covers commission payout, cost estimation, quoting and
billing.

Commission
----------

### Commission Basics

Countable pays up to 15% commission to those who help schedule new work
contracts for us externally, and up to 7.5% internally. The total
commission doesn\'t exceed 15%.

Commission is paid out upon receipt of payment from the associated
project.

### Proposal Writing

Commission is divided as follows.

-   We pay 1.5% to whoever creates the outline checking grammar +
    spelling, copies content from related past proposals, coordinating
    deadline, and submitting. (admin)
-   We pay 1.5% to whoever is responsible for sending the qualifying
    questions, identifies the contributor team, and doing internal
    evaluation and review. (manager)
-   We pay 3% to the technical authors who develop the proposal content
    and artwork. (contributor team)
-   We pay 1.5% to whoever finds the proposal and suggests it to the
    team to write. If it\'s from a source we always follow, this amount
    is kept. (sourcer)

Cost Estimation
---------------

Software project cost estimation is [notoriously
difficult](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html).
A typical problem is the team appears to have 70% of the information
when estimating a project, when they really have 30% because by
definition, they can\'t see black swan conditions (unknown unknowns).

### Effort Estimation Process

For all projects:

-   Make sure you summarize the purpose of the work at the top of any
    estimation document.
-   Ask for any details you can to reduce scope uncertainty. Book a
    (voice) meeting to review this and discuss.
-   Tell the client what you need by when to finish within the budget
    (data, access, creds).
-   Determine their deadline, and build a prototype that captures the
    general idea of the system within 25% of the alloted time.

Quoting
-------

Some companies require a quote in order to issue a purchase order. This
is appropriate when:

-   The amount is at least \$5,000.
-   The work is very well understood. We\'ve done something very similar
    before, and understand the steps clearly.

A template is
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IJtCsBL-rHwEkd0tcScvZM3IO5Auq3BLQeJSMywc8k/edit?usp=sharing).
To fill it:

-   Fill in 1 to 5 days of effort per line item. Don\'t separate items
    which are under a day, batch them.
-   Each line item should be for a different team member. To get the day
    rate, multiply that person\'s standard hourly rate by 8 hours. The
    standard hourly rate (as with other agencies) is around 2.5 times
    the team member\'s hourly salary, although this varies. You can get
    the hourly rate from our accounting team.

### Client Quotes

Clients may request a budget in an RFP, or a quote for a specific piece
of work. Keep the following in mind:

> -   Break the work down into about 1 day line items (8 hours), with
>     appropriate level of detail. On larger projects, up to a week can
>     be in a single line item.
> -   Our minimum quotable amount is \$3,000. Amounts below this should
>     instead be approved via a simple email message or Trello ticket
>     from someone authorized to approve the work.
> -   Separate quotes or budgets to be completed at different phases and
>     specify the order (priority).
> -   The quote should provide a clear scope of functional
>     specification, and list assumptions it is based on in order to
>     simplify determining whether later changes are in scope or not.
> -   Use [this
>     template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gc_xjX-SnOvQ9QemLBrsYtPrBZISqT4H7qFw_Wkn3Co/edit#gid=0).
> -   The big caveat with providing a quote, is it affects the work
>     outcome. It may help keep the team focused on what\'s promised in
>     the quote, but also may prevent fixing problems we find along the
>     way, or looking into opportunities because of the concern of scope
>     creep. This may result in a substantial loss of competitive
>     advantage so we\'d encourage our clients to avoid using quotes
>     most of the time. Instead, budget 25% of the original budget for a
>     prototype to multiply your knowledge of the problem at hand, and
>     the decide what to do. At this point the work will likely be much
>     more clear and incremental.

Billing
-------

We have several models depending on what works for a client. Two most
common / preferred:

1.  Write a spec and give a quote. Estimate the number of days each work
    item will take. When it\'s approved, put the tasks from the spec in
    your Scrum Backlog. Whenever something new is added, it pushes down
    off bottom of the backlog (into the Ideas column ideally) and we
    explain to the client those items won\'t be done since we\'re doing
    their new request instead.
2.  With other clients, we have a backlog and a retainer, so we try to
    work on the backlog a certain \# of hours per week and use the
    Sprint meeting to ensure they\'re happy with progress for what
    they\'re paying.

Invoicing Clients
-----------------

Describing client-facing processes around invoicing, and the
expectations on both sides.

### Process

Clients are invoiced before the 10th of each month, and given 30 days to
pay for work completed in the previous month. Depending on the client,
there may be:

1.  SaaS fees
2.  A retainer amount for advisor services, on-call or maintenance work
3.  Portions for completed phases of a flat fee amount
4.  An hourly itemized amount (we prefer to avoid these, since it\'s
    better for clients if we charge for value created, not time spent.
    This helps us collaborate with the client to increase value)

If the amount expected to be invoiced in a single month exceeds the
client\'s credit amount, they must pay a deposit so their credit is not
exceeded. If a client has paid at least 3 invoices in a row, on time,
they may apply for a credit increase. The credit should not exceed the
total invoiced over the last 3 months. This credit is only usable for
the month work is acted on, and 30 day grace period (see below).

### Phased Invoices

For projects in category 3 above (flat fee), phases with dates should be
identified, so it\'s clear how much is due at each time.

### Overdue Invoices

We take overdue invoices seriously, in order to weed out clients who do
not pay on time. By following this policy, over time we will only retain
clients who are able to pay within the agreed term (30 days). While
we\'d like to be nice about this, we\'ve found that some clients may
abuse that and will use us as a source of financing, which is not our
purpose.

Overdue invoices must be acted on. Here are the escalation steps in
order of severity. Also, new projects and quotes cannot be started or
issued when an amount is in arrears.

1 week overdue: The client receives a warning. We cannot issue more than
one warning per client per year. If a client has already been warned, we
must skip this escalation step. 2 weeks overdue: The client\'s credit is
reduced, by default to 50% of its\' previous value. Record this in the
client sheet. 3 weeks overdue: The client is issued late fees, if
applicable (if they are using our contract). If so, they may stay at
this escalation level as long as late fees are paid within the next 30
days and every 30 days after, and the invoiced amount does not exceed
their credit. 4 weeks overdue: We stop doing any work for the client,
including urgent maintenance work. 5 weeks overdue: The debt is sold to
a collection agency, and the client is black-listed.
