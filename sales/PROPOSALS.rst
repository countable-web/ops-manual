Proposals
=========

**Purpose**

The following are actionable tactics to improve the ROI of time spent writing proposals. 

**Scope**

Covers principles and process for finding and writing proposals at Countable. 
The author is most experienced writing proposals for the public sector.

Principles
----------

-  The process starts before you start writing. You want to make sure
   the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing
   anything.
-  Specialize! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old
   proposals that worked. It's better to solve the same problem really
   well than to spread yourself thin. Choose an RFP in an area where you
   have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to
   hilight), and have a network of people in that area. Countable's
   niches are `web maps <https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=143&v=PwVRi37qXn8&feature=emb_logo>`__,
   `healthcare <https://cortico.ca>`__ and optimizing citizen flows for
   government.
-  Use your network's experience, and team up. If you know someone who
   would be really great to add to your team, write them into the
   proposal too, and give them a small cut just for being present, even
   if they do very little work.
-  Score before you Send. Get someone who understands the client to
   evaluate your proposal and give you a score based on the official
   criteria before you submit.
-  Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project, before writing.
   Your questions should increase trust, fill in blanks, and unearth
   hidden needs behind the RFP. Find out the truth about whether you can
   knock it out of the park. Examples "Would you consider a team outside
   your industry who can bring fresh ideas, or prefer a firm with lots
   of industry experience?"
-  Keep the proposal as short as possible while addressing the criteria
   and building trust.

Process
-------

In brackets, we indicate the approximate time to allocate (not actual
effort, just time to leave open)

1. CAPTURE - find RFPs you can win
2. PRE-QUALIFY - look a bit deeper
3. QUALIFY - (5 days) ask questions, wait for responses
4. WRITE - (2 to 10 days)
5. REVIEW - (5 days) use an external/impartial reviewer to simulate
   grading the proposal
6. SUBMIT - (1 day)
7. LEARN - update this document

1. RFP Lead Capture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Record the RFP due date, organization and link in a spreadsheet, along
with its score as follows:

-  20 points if the RFP is in your niche of products and services.
   Partial points if the industry matches, but not the exact
   service/product (it's nearby).
-  10 points for tech match. Mention of any from: Django, Node,
   Postgres, Vue, React, javascript, web mapping, etc. Deduct points for
   .NET, SAP.
-  10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio
   value.
-  10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
-  10 points if Scrum or Agile is mentioned, partial (5) points if it
   the project is phased with a prototype.
-  20 points for contract size. 0 for $10k, 5 for $20k, 10 for $50k, 15
   for $100k, 20 for $200k and up, 15 for over $500k, 10 for over $1M.
-  10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the
   scoring.
-  BONUS points if it's an existing relationship, we can keep the IP for
   future use, or open source it, or some other circumstance.

50 points is the cut-off for moving on to PRE-QUALIFY

.. _2-pre-qualify:

2. Pre-qualify
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Review all evaluation criteria. What is the estimated score we could
   get on the project? Is it within 5% of frontrunner's estimated score?
   If not, move on.
2. Look deeper at the proposal to see if it's in your niche and you have
   a uniquely great offering that will both let you execute well and
   develop your niche stratgically. If not, move on.
3. Estimate bid size, based on beating the frontrunner's score by 5%. If
   there's no budget for the project, estimate one based on past similar
   projects by the frontrunner, prospect, and software category. Is this
   amount profitable? If not, move on.
4. Is the total timeline under 10 days? If so, the proposal is probably
   "wired" to be given to a specific company. Skip it.
5. Determine who is the "frontrunner", most likely to bid and win the
   project. Is there a strong off-the-shelf solution which is
   compatible, with a local supplier? What is the industry "state of the
   art" in this area. What is being used by others? What companies have
   won similar projects in the past. What vendors have the client used
   for similar projects before? Who has beat you on similar RFPs before?
   Public sector projects will often list applicants directly, or you
   will be able to identify them in the Q&A addendum shared with the
   group a few days in.

.. _3-qualify:

3. Qualify
~~~~~~~~~~

You'll want to ask a few questions before writing. If possible, get on
the phone with someone in order to make a "conceptual agreement". The
goals are to get the interest and then the guidance of the buyer, and
understand their priorities. Demonstrate a genuine interest in the
outcome of the project, build trust, and fill in gaps regarding how well
the proposals fits.

1. If any of the critical info in our capture questions is unknown, ask
   it now (approx budget, technology options, can we use Scrum,
2. Ask: What is the most important benefit to this project for a
   successful outcome?
3. Make a super clear, one sentence statement of your unique approach.
   Ask the prospect if it's a good approach.
4. Ask questions to clarify any scoring criteria so you're 100% clear
   what they each mean.
5. Ask questions to help you understand what the evaluators are looking
   for.
6. If the project solves a real problem, there should be an existing
   (partial, bad) solution. Ask "How are you currently getting by
   without this solution? What process will we be replacing?".
7. Get clarity on anything that might disqualify you, if you're unsure
   about any of the mandatory criteria.
8. If any key consideration is left out of the proposal, ask if it's
   important the product be: Secure, Flexible, Scalable, Low maintenance
   or total ownership cost, Durable data.

Also, create several touchpoints (LinkedIn, email, phone) to get to know
them before you write. If there's a way to demonstrate your system
woring, that is ideal.

Attend any pre-proposal call, webinar or meeting in order to meet the
evaluators.

Do any further research to have information you need to decide to write.

4. Deciding to Write
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With all the above done, you should now determine whether to write, or
move on to a new RFP. You should know your approximate chances of
winning, the value of the contract, and your alternatives, and make the
best choice.

Are you the frontrunner? If not, can you propose a solution that is
better in some way that matters to the prospect? The answer to one of
these questions should be YES if you want to write. You must believe you
have a good chance of winning based on all the information so far.
