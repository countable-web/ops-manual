# Project Structure

(draft)

**Purpose**

This contains internal project setup instructions. TODO: move this to the project management area of the manual.

**Scope**

Here we provide a checklist of key steps and expectations to set when starting a new project.

Onboarding New Clients
----------------------

Steps for onboarding a client:

-  A contract must be signed with the client.
-  In the contract appendix A, our services should be summarized, along
   with any key opportunities or problems we can help with.
-  Create a project in Trello, a Slack Channel, shared Google Drive folder, and any necessary code
   repositories.


Lead Time
~~~~~~~~~

-  The team's capacity must be checked, and then a start date and project
   delivery timeline can be determined.

Minimum Billable Amount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Any additional request (ie, via email) for technical work (anything
   not administrative, that requires opening adobe illustrator for
   example), we have a minimum 1h billable. Multiple requests received
   in a short period can be bundled to get closer to 1h of work. This
   encourages both of us to batch requests. This number (1h) is low
   enough that both sides are incentivized to avoid a huge number of
   small requests since it's much less efficient that way.

Budget Changes During the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  During the project, if we expect to exceed the budget, tell the
   client and your manager ASAP, and explain what happened.
-  If the client finds the billed amount unreasonable or something you
   didn't ask for, it's free! In practice, this rarely happens and we
   also often finish early which balances out. If it happens a lot and
   can't be solved by communication, the client is a bad fit for us, and
   we shouldn't be working with them. Inability to communicate on
   budgets is a useful way to identify a bad client relationship.
