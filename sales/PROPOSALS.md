Proposals
=========

**Purpose**

The following are actionable tactics to improve the ROI of time spent
writing proposals.

**Scope**

Covers principles and process for finding and writing proposals at
Countable. The author is most experienced writing proposals for the
public sector.

Principles
----------

-   The process starts before you start writing. You want to make sure
    the odds are stacked in your favour before you invest in writing
    anything.
-   Specialize! Choose similar projects, so you can re-use bits of old
    proposals that worked. It\'s better to solve the same problem really
    well than to spread yourself thin. Choose an RFP in an area where
    you have the most expertise, similar work (including successes to
    hilight), and have a network of people in that area. Countable\'s
    niches are [web
    maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=143&v=PwVRi37qXn8&feature=emb_logo),
    [healthcare](https://cortico.ca) and optimizing citizen flows for
    government.
-   Use your network\'s experience, and team up. If you know someone who
    would be really great to add to your team, write them into the
    proposal too, and give them a small cut just for being present, even
    if they do very little work.
-   Score before you Send. Get someone who understands the client to
    evaluate your proposal and give you a score based on the official
    criteria before you submit.
-   Ask questions to qualify or disqualify the project, before writing.
    Your questions should increase trust, fill in blanks, and unearth
    hidden needs behind the RFP. Find out the truth about whether you
    can knock it out of the park. Examples \"Would you consider a team
    outside your industry who can bring fresh ideas, or prefer a firm
    with lots of industry experience?\"
-   Keep the proposal as short as possible while addressing the criteria
    and building trust.

Process
-------

In brackets, we indicate the approximate time to allocate (not actual
effort, just time to leave open)

1.  CAPTURE - find RFPs you can win (This should be happening all the
    time as described in
    [Sales](https://countable-ops-manual.readthedocs.io/sales/SALES.html))
2.  PRE-QUALIFY - look a bit deeper (Score in our OPPORTUNITIES sheet)
3.  QUALIFY - (5 days) (ask questions as soon as possible after deciding
    to write, wait for responses)
4.  DRAFT - (2 to 6 days) (coordinator creates working doc right away,
    tags people in based on roles and expertise)
5.  REVIEW - (2-3 days) (use an external/impartial reviewer to simulate
    grading the proposal)
6.  REFINE - (1-3 days) (incorporate requested changes, saving time for
    one major refinement/copyedit) (**Note**: we\'ll now observe a
    *content freeze* one full day before submission to allow for this)
7.  SUBMIT - (1 day)
8.  LEARN - save any feedback we get on RFPs in the same folder; update
    this document as we learn

Further notes to the above process points:

-   Reserve the last day for polishing (no new content contributions, by
    design)
-   48 hours before the deadline is the last point we can do the
    offiical review/scoring.
-   For contributors, the coordinator should indicate what portions they
    should look at. Most people don\'t need to read the whole thing.
-   Provide some indexing on what documents we have, for easier
    navigation of the repo?
-   By the 48 hours mark, a good quality version with all content and a
    lens to evaluation (in navigation) should be present.

Scoring Opportunities
---------------------

In the Opportunities (SCORE) spreadsheet, we allot Pipeline % in the
following manner:

-   When we\'ve decided to apply for an opportunity, set it at 20%
-   When the application is clearly moving forward/we\'re a frontrunner,
    set it at 50%
-   When we\'ve received the opportunity, set it at 100%
-   If we\'ve lost the opportunity, set it at 0%

### 1. RFP Lead Capture {#1-rfp-lead-capture}

Record the RFP due date, organization and link in a spreadsheet, along
with its score as follows:

-   20 points if the RFP is in your niche of products and services.
    Partial points if the industry matches, but not the exact
    service/product (it\'s nearby).
-   10 points for tech match. Mention of any from: Django, Node,
    Postgres, Vue, React, javascript, web mapping, etc. Deduct points
    for .NET, SAP.
-   10 points if the final result publicly browsable, for portfolio
    value.
-   10 if scoring criteria is explained in the RFP.
-   10 points if Scrum or Agile is mentioned, partial (5) points if it
    the project is phased with a prototype.
-   20 points for contract size. 0 for \$10k, 5 for \$20k, 10 for \$50k,
    15 for \$100k, 20 for \$200k and up, 15 for over \$500k, 10 for over
    \$1M. (This reflects our **ideal project budget range** of
    \$100-500k)
-   10 points if the RFP offers losing proposals a debrief on the
    scoring.
-   BONUS points if it\'s an existing relationship, we can keep the IP
    for future use, or open source it, or some other circumstance.

50 points is the cut-off for moving on to PRE-QUALIFY

### 2. Pre-qualify {#2-pre-qualify}

1.  Review all evaluation criteria. What is the estimated score we could
    get on the project? Is it within 5% of frontrunner\'s estimated
    score? If not, move on.
2.  Look deeper at the proposal to see if it\'s in your niche and you
    have a uniquely great offering that will both let you execute well
    and develop your niche stratgically. If not, move on.
3.  Estimate bid size, based on beating the frontrunner\'s score by 5%.
    If there\'s no budget for the project, estimate one based on past
    similar projects by the frontrunner, prospect, and software
    category. Is this amount profitable? If not, move on.
4.  Is the total timeline under 10 days? If so, the proposal is probably
    \"wired\" to be given to a specific company. Skip it.
5.  Determine who is the \"frontrunner\", most likely to bid and win the
    project. Is there a strong off-the-shelf solution which is
    compatible, with a local supplier? What is the industry \"state of
    the art\" in this area. What is being used by others? What companies
    have won similar projects in the past. What vendors have the client
    used for similar projects before? Who has beat you on similar RFPs
    before? Public sector projects will often list applicants directly,
    or you will be able to identify them in the Q&A addendum shared with
    the group a few days in.

### 3. Qualify {#3-qualify}

You\'ll want to ask a few questions before writing. If possible, get on
the phone with someone in order to make a \"conceptual agreement\". The
goals are to get the interest and then the guidance of the buyer, and
understand their priorities. Demonstrate a genuine interest in the
outcome of the project, build trust, and fill in gaps regarding how well
the proposals fits.

1.  If any of the critical info in our capture questions is unknown, ask
    it now (approx budget, technology options, can we use Scrum,
2.  Ask: What is the most important benefit to this project for a
    successful outcome?
3.  Make a super clear, one sentence statement of your unique approach.
    Ask the prospect if it\'s a good approach.
4.  Ask questions to clarify any scoring criteria so you\'re 100% clear
    what they each mean.
5.  Ask questions to help you understand what the evaluators are looking
    for.
6.  If the project solves a real problem, there should be an existing
    (partial, bad) solution. Ask \"How are you currently getting by
    without this solution? What process will we be replacing?\".
7.  Get clarity on anything that might disqualify you, if you\'re unsure
    about any of the mandatory criteria.
8.  If any key consideration is left out of the proposal, ask if it\'s
    important the product be: Secure, Flexible, Scalable, Low
    maintenance or total ownership cost, Durable data.

Also, create several touchpoints (LinkedIn, email, phone) to get to know
them before you write. If there\'s a way to demonstrate your system
woring, that is ideal.

Attend any pre-proposal call, webinar or meeting in order to meet the
evaluators.

Do any further research to have information you need to decide to write.

### 4. Deciding to Write {#4-deciding-to-write}

With all the above done, you should now determine whether to write, or
move on to a new RFP. You should know your approximate chances of
winning, the value of the contract, and your alternatives, and make the
best choice.

Are you the frontrunner? If not, can you propose a solution that is
better in some way that matters to the prospect? The answer to one of
these questions should be YES if you want to write. You must believe you
have a good chance of winning based on all the information so far.

Proposal Writing Roles
----------------------

**Assign these roles to people at the top of the proposal draft:**

#### Coordinator

This is the most important role in the process, driving forward everyone
else\'sales involvement and contributions. The coordinator\'s job is to
make sure: \* The rest of the process below is followed by our team. \*
It\'s clear in writing (Google Docs comments) who contributes what parts
right away. \* We finish early so we have time (ideally 5 days) for
external review. \* Double-check each contributor doesn\'t miss any
mandatory requirements or scored criteria. \* Compiling the final
deliverables in the correct format for submission. \* The proposal is
submitted on-time, making sure that any submission pre-requisites are
met well in advance. Submitting right before the deadline will often
result in a failure to submit correctly.

#### Internal Reviewer

Identify someone to simulate the client scoring your proposal later on.
They shouldn\'t be involved in writing.

When they are tagged in to review the document, they should be directed
in a meaningful way to not just the working document, but the original
RFP description and specific evaluation criteria or rubric.

#### Technical Authors

The Coordinator should ensure it\'s clear to each technical author what
section they must contribute. Use Google Docs task assignments.

#### Getting Organized

1.  Create a folder for the proposal in Google Drive
2.  Save the original RFP and any supporting documents there.
3.  Past the mandatory and scored criteria from the RFP into a new
    Google Doc (in the color RED) to start a proposal outline (see
    below)
4.  Include, at the top of the outline (in the color GREEN): who is
    filling each of the Roles defined above, links to similar successful
    proposals and notes on their score, any answers to questions we
    wrote, or notes from the qualification process.

#### Outline

Copy most if not all of the original proposal into a Google Doc, invite
everyone who will work on it, and proceed to copy the structure of the
original RFP as your proposal structure. Write your proposal inline to
the original RFP.

Write responses inline to the original RFP and mirror RFP document structure. Then, add the following sections if they\'re not already there, but keep them very small/simple.

:   -   In the intro (if applicable), summarize the real needs
        underlying the proposal.
    -   Who is the buyer\'s customer and how will they benefit?
    -   Indicate how technology has changed recently to allow a better
        solution, and how we deliver that.
    -   Indicate a low total cost of ownership, and side benefits to
        their business. Indicate they\'ll want to use the new system all
        the time.
    -   Indicate why your company is specifically interested in this
        project and its results.
    -   What makes your solution unique?
    -   High level summary of your approach, with evidence from past
        projects that it will work.
    -   How will a successful outcome be measured?

#### Writing Style

> -   Optimize for clarity, not sophistication or length.
> -   It should be clear how every sentence relates to the evlauation
>     criteria. If any sentence is not clearly providing evidence or
>     building trust, remove it. Efficient communication that knows just
>     what to leave out is a great demonstration of confidence and
>     expertise.
> -   Include an visual or diagrams (about one every 2 pages)
> -   Use the active voice, with optimistic tone.
> -   Mention the customer, more often than you mention your own
>     company.

#### Angle

What really matters (hidden need), and why will you deliver it better than the other bidders?

:   -   How is your approach different and will lead to a better result?
    -   How does this project relate to your mission, values, and your
        team\'s experience? Include a couple stories about this, to
        create a special connection to the project.

In particular, if you\'re not the frontrunner, this is critical. Plant a
seed of doubt about the frontrunner and build on that. A good one is
that as a newcomer you can provide more customization because your
product is still more flexible and early in its development lifecycle.

If you are the a frontrunner, point to your past successes. Your angle
is to create concern that other solutions don\'t have as much evidence
of ability to deliver.

#### Team

Include photos and some personal notes that relate each team member to
the project, and their relevant past successes.

#### Case Studies

> -   Highlight their industry, location and other parts of their
>     identity.
> -   Draw attention to the relevance of your prior work.
> -   Leave out details that don\'t indicate how similar your prior
>     projects are to the current RFP, or how successful they were.

#### Platform

List features of your platform that align with the real problems behind
the RFP and the stated criteria, and for each feature, list the benefits
which solve those problems and provide evidence.

#### Addressing Criteria

If the RFP has scoring criteria already, this should be your focus.

Don\'t try to be clever and make up a proposal structure based on your
domain knowledge. Instead, write your proposal inline to the original
RFP, and include the original wording in a different font. This will
make it easy to mark, clear you\'ve missed no mandatory criteria, and
clear how to score you.

In each section, the person creating the outline should make a note of
the person from our team best qualified to write that section so it\'s
very clear who is contributing each section of the proposal. Mention and
assign that person using a Google Docs comment.

There are usually 2 types of criteria. First, a list of things that
could disqualify you. Second, a list of categories where you can score
points.

For the first category, make a checklist and make sure you\'re 100%
confident in those items being checked off before you submit. For the
actual scoring, it\'s likely the prospect has a committee reviewing
scores, and likely they\'ll even be \"blind\". This means they\'ll be
worried about being perceived as unfair, and will usually follow the
criteria quite literally.

For scoring criteria that are clear, focus on creating the most truthful
answer that will get the highest score. Get a \"proxy\" person to score
you, and iterate to improve your score.

For scoring criteria that are less clear, there\'s going to be more
subjectivity. Find out what probably matters most to your evaluators,
going back to the questions you asked earlier.

### 5. External Review Step {#5-external-review}

> -   Get an external reviewer to pretend to be the buyer.
> -   They must evaluate according to the official criteria.
> -   Refine before sending.

### 6. Submit {#6-submit}

Submission platforms can be buggy or broken sometimes, so get familiar
with the platform you are submitting on and click through to the last
step right away. Make sure you leave enough time to submit: we recommend
submitting 1 day in advance in case something goes wrong.

### 7. Learn {#7-learn}

The best way to measure proposal win-rate is \"revenue won\" / \"revenue
bid\", because it reflects the proposal value.

50% is a sweet spot to aim for, to balance risk-taking and revenue.

Get a debriefing whenever possible.

Specific Proposal Types:
------------------------

#### Bidding Against ERPs

Often, we are proposing a Django based project as a more flexible,
cheaper, faster and more maintainable alternative to an ERP
implementation (Enterprise Resource Planning). Here are some problems
with ERPs that we solve for our clients:

> -   It takes an average of 11 months after go-live for SMBs to realize
>     benefits from an ERP \[1\], whereas our implementations typically
>     realize benefits in 6 to 8 weeks due to our rapid prototyping
>     approach in the first 2 weeks.
> -   In an ERP usage survey, only 14 of 287 respondents reported
>     realizing the benefits of \"Upgrading Technology\" with an ERP,
>     and 34 of 150 respondents realized the \"Growth\"-related goals
>     they had when implementing ERP. ERP were more effective at
>     realizing \"Operational Efficiency\" goals, however with 103 of
>     122 respondents reporting success.
> -   Regarding ERPs \"Of those organizations that have completed
>     implementation, less than half (45%) experienced budget overruns.
>     However, those that did experience overruns were an average of 24%
>     over budget. When

you're talking about an implementation budget, 24% is a lot of money. On
average, organizations reported an expected budget of \$1,007,767 and an
actual budget of \$1,247,859.\" \[1\]
